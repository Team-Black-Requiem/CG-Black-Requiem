 ### Modules
 
 ### Engines/Suspension
 tank_torsion_bar_suspension:0 "Torsion Bar"
 tank_torsion_bar_suspension_desc:0 "A fairly reliable suspension system of metal bars fixed to the vehicle chassis that provides a smoother ride than other suspension types."
 tank_interleaved_suspension:0 "Interleaved Roadwheels"
 tank_interleaved_suspension_desc:0 "By overlapping the roadwheels, more of them can be fit in the same length of the hull, thereby improving mobility as well as providing some additional protection in the flanks."
 tank_christie_suspension:0 "Christie Suspension"
 tank_christie_suspension_desc:0 "Developed by an American inventor, this supension allows for exceptionally high speeds."
 tank_bogie_suspension:0 "Bogie Suspension"
 tank_bogie_suspension_desc:0 "A simple and fairly cheap type of suspension in which the roadwheels are mounted individually, allowing them to be easily replaced if damaged."

 hydropneumatic_suspension:0 "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 hydropneumatic_suspension_desc:0 "Filler text because I don't know how to write good."

 tank_wheeled_suspension:0 "Wheeled Suspension"
 tank_wheeled_suspension_desc:0 "Derived from a truck chassis, this suspension is very limited in its carrying capacity and has limited cross-country performance, but has the advantage of being very cheap to make."
 tank_half_track_suspension:0 "Half-track Suspension"
 tank_half_track_suspension_desc:0 "A hybrid between a fully-tracked vehicle and a regular wheeled suspension, this setup has a pair of wheels up front for steering and a tracked rear axle to improve cross-country performance. While limited in its carrying capacity, it is still cheaper than a fully-tracked design."
 ### Weapons
 
 ### Super Structure
 
 ### Armor Section
 tank_cast_armor:0 "Casted armor"
 tank_improved_cast_armor:0 "Improved Armor Castings"
 tank_rivet_armor:0 "Riveted Armor"
 tank_weld_armor:0 "Welded Tank Armor"
 tank_weld_armor_desc:0 "By taking advantage of Metallurgy we are able to connect our armor together stronger than cast armor ever could. This does of course mean that more time will be spent preparing, welding, and inspecting our armor but, the result will be the finest metallurgy can achieve."
 sakuradite_tank_armor:0 "Sakuradite Flaked Armor"
 tank_minimal_armor:0 "Minimal Armor"
 tank_well_balanced_armor:0 "Well-balanced Armor Layout"
 tank_frontal_focus_armor:0 "Frontal Armor Focus"
 tank_composite_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
 ### Special Modules/Ammunition
 apfsds:0 "APFSDS Rounds"
 apfsds_desc:0 "Armor-piercing Fin-stabilized Discarding Sabot (AFDSDS) sacrifices the fragmentation produced by HE found in typical rounds like APHEBC to achieve speeds up to 1,800 m/s. APFSDS also sacrifice some post spalling due to a decreased surface area that would be penetrated but is mostly made up by the penetrator and fins. Combining the shell's increased shell speed, reduced drag, and Depleted Uranium penetrator, the shell boosts an impressive penetration value of around 800mm vs flat steel."
 ### Stuff I never finished writing because of Ammunition potenitally being removed
 aphecbc:0 "APHECBC Rounds"
 aphecbc_desc:0 "Armor-piercing High-Explosive Capped ballistic Capped (APHECBC)"
 heatfs:0 "HEATFS Rounds"
 heatfs_desc:0 "High-Explosive Anti-tank Fin-stabilized"
 hesh:0 "HESH Rounds"
 hesh_desc:0 "High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH)"
 proximity:0 "Proximity Fuse Warheads"
 proximity_desc:0 "Proximity Rounds are the modern version of old | I never finished writing this apparently"
 ### End of section I didn't finish writing
 fragmentation:0 "Fragmentation Rounds"
 fragmentation_desc:0 "Fragmentation Rounds are similar to artillery Rounds with the exception that they aren't made to destroy terrain and fortifications but, rather litter large areas with tons of fragmentation."
 sakuradite_charges:0 "Sakuradite Enhanced Rounds"
 sakuradite_charges_desc:0 "By harnessing the powers of Sakuradite, we are able to push our Rounds to the absolute limits achieving speeds that would destroy traditional APFSDS and make Depleted Uranium look like a child's play toy."
