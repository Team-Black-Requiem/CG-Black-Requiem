anglia.1.d:0 "Well done so far, now we're going into the 2 main areas of working with focuses, General Implementation, and Frameworking \n\n Frameworking means to layout the focus tree, putting things where they need to be, making some exclusive, making sure it works well and looks good. \n\n General implementation is making sure the focuses do something, this is what you've been doing so far, but it also includes creating events, ideas, sometimes characters, locking out other focuses, and more. \n\n If you need  help on how to create events and localisation, you can look back at this in the code, and look at how it's done."

anglia.2.d:0 "Welcome to the introduction to Frameworks. \n\n Here, you will learn the basics of creating a framework, using mutual exclusives, either or, and relative position ids. \n\n The term Framework in the sense of hoi 4 modding, just means to set up the basic layout of a focus tree, without effects added onto it. This is what you will learn to do now."
