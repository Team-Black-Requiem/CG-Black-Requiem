second_kururugi_term_desc:0 "Victory!\nOnce again, our party has achieved the most votes in the country!\nNow it’s time to officially form the cabinet of the new government, although we will be forced to compromise with the powerful industrial groups and the liberal party Rikken Minseito, which is right now positioned in second place."
parliament_supremacy:0 "Dominance in Parliament"
parliament_supremacy_desc:0 "With a series of lobbying and compromises between Conservative and Liberal deputies, an almost-absolute majority has been reached. In this way, we won't be bogged down by useless stonewalling and we will be able to pass our political agenda; although we will be forced to deal with small requests or guarantees from time to time."
press_influence:0 "Press "Support""
press_influence_desc:0 "Obviously, a powerful party needs some good advertisements to maintain a clean public face. Luckily, most newspapers in Japan have a strong conformist tendency and it'd be sufficient some pressure from the industrial corporation to settle things down."
foreign_problems:0 "Our Place in the World"
foreign_problems_desc:0 "Japan has been embracing a philosophy of total neutrality since the terrible defeats in the First Pacific War. Despite this, we can still use our soft power in the Pacific Ocean or Asia without any direct confrontation. That's the reason we've become and we'll continue to be the Jewel of the Pacific."
sakuradite_power:0 "The Power of Sakuradite"
sakuradite_power_desc:0 "Sakuradite can be considered as the real protagonist behind the recent economic stability of Japan, but who said we can't further exploit the needs of our neighbors to swell the revenues and provoke a real economic boom?"
brit_treaty:0 "A Deal with the Devil"
brit_treaty_desc:0 "The brutal administration of Britannia is well known in the world, but we can turn a blind eye in these matters, in exchange for a temporal truce on a series of annoying decrees imposed by the Emperor. In particular, we'll face a drastic reduction of tariffs for resource exportation into the enormous internal market of the Empire."
china_treaty:0 "New Chinese Loans"
china_treaty_desc:0 "The Chinese Empire is well disposed to continue its generous loans for the discovery and development of Sakuradite deposits. Of course, we know the true intentions of the Eunuchs, but Minister Kirihara has assured that any foreign influence will be kept in control by the Kyoto Families."
eu_treaty:0 "Attract the European Giants"

great_gamble:0 "The Final Move"
great_gamble_desc:0 "It is now or never. Our economic policy will be sustainable for the State's balance only for the next few months and we have to do something. This is going to be the greatest achievement of the Kururugi's government or its worst failure."

house_always_win_desc:0 "With the labour market in perfect balance and a rapid development of military industry, we have achieved a virtuous cycle that will carry the entire economy of Japan!

fixing_our_mistakes_desc:0 "Kirihara has proposed a counterbalance that might bring back the situation to manageable levels.

good_start:0 "A Good Start"

enforce_blockade:0 "Enforce The Blockade"
enforce_blockade_desc:0 "An important step to contain Britannia will be a nearly-total blockade of strategic resources, especially Sakuradite.

close_embassy:0 "Close The Embassy"
close_embassy_desc:0 "Although this we'll be mostly a symbolic act, we are going to forcefully close the Britannian embassy in Tokyo. This will only worsen the already sour relations between the country, but it'd be a huge political gain both inside Japan and abroad."

chinese_advisors:0 "Chinese Military Advisors"
chinese_advisors_desc:0 "China is the main opponent of Britannia in the Pacific and the closest superpower to our nation. Perhaps, we can train our officers in the Militarized Zone of Korea and learn their planning and defensive skills, although we won't be able to rely on their larger army."
import_guns:0 "Massive Guns Imports"
import_guns_desc:0 "Japan's military arsenal has been neglected for too long since the start of the new millennium.

EU_advisors:0 "European Military Advisors"
EU_advisors_desc:0 "Japan and EU have a history of international solidarity, since the two nations share a great number of democratic and moral values. Although it'd be more difficult to reach the superpower, we can send our officers to Russia and learn their famous offensive tactics."

conscription_laws_desc:0 "The most important measure is going to be the re-introduction of of compulsory conscription.

nationalist_support:0 " A Nationalist Backing?"
nationalist_support_desc:0 "So far we have obtained few results in the recent demographic reports and we are beginning to run out of ideas. Despite this, some nationalist MPs are calling for a radical approach to the question, and the Kururugi administration has found itself splinted in two opposing factions."
ban_abortion:0 "Criminalize Abortion"
ban_abortion_desc:0 "As promised to the Rightist Faction, we are going to pass a series of laws that will severely restrict abortion possibilities for women. Obviously, it will quickly cause a waves of instability and protests in the country, but we can always just ignore them and wait for a cooldown."
no_birth_control:0 "Deregulate Birth Control"
no_birth_control_desc:0 "Wiping out most of the annoying bureaucracy in demographic offices is another important step, since it'll severely loosen much of the obstacles to an almost free birth policy. Furthermore, our ministers have warned us that this will cause a severe backlash in the country."
suprise_invasion:0 "Surprise Attack!"
suprise_invasion_desc:0 "Kururugi was right after all!\nThe Britannians are landing on Japan's coasts, while an unofficial declaration of war has been delivered through naval and air bombings. Japan can only hope to fight back and wait for China and EU's help."

bunkers_building:0 "Use Emergency Bunkers!"
bunkers_building_desc:0 "The firepower of Britannia has proven to be immense and our army won’t be able to bear it any more.

bring_todoh:0 "Support Todoh In First Line!"
bring_todoh_desc:0 "Lieutenant Tohdoh represents a glimpse of hope in this war, since he is the only one who managed to inflict humiliating defeats to the Britannians. Considering this, the Committee has proposed a close collaboration with Tohdoh and his eventual promotion to higher positions."

this_is_not_working_desc:0 "The fatherland is falling.\nInches by inches, city by city, the Britannians are sweeping though our defence lines and the army is at a breaking point.

Furthermore, the government will be ready to take... drastic measures for Japan."
reasserting_control:0 "Reasserting Control"
reasserting_control_desc:0 "Our next moves will be, saying at least, radical and we can’t wait for the inefficiency of a parliament or a democratic system.

Executing secret plans of the police force, mobilizing every single army unit that we have access to, securing vital facilities of the city and protecting our people from this madness - only the beginning of what we need to do to deal with this rebellion of madmen that want to put whole Japan at risk of downfall.

The operation revealed that Prime Minister Kururugi had been shot by demonstrators and died of his wounds in hospital. An emergency meeting of Parliament appointed Kirihara Taizo as Acting Prime Minister. Perhaps it is he who ruled from the shadows for so long, who can bring the country, which has sunk so deeply into darkness, back into the light."

JAP.1.t:0 "A Demographic Nightmare"
JAP.1.d:0 "The last statistics of our interior minister are, at least, worrying. Our population has been in an extremely dangerous phase of decline for many decades but most administrations simply ignored the problem. They believed this issue could be postponed forever, but instead it got worse year after year.\n\n Furthermore, the interaction of many factors has caused the birth of the problem, like the high standard of living, which demotivated young people to marry or make a family, but also a huge social pressure that affected the male population.\n\n Eventually the industrial corporations started an average pressure on us in order to make something about it, since the situation is going to destroy the job market in the long term and the first cracks are now obvious."
JAP.1.a:0 "Better Get To Work"

JAP.2.t:0 "The Proposal"
JAP.2.d:0 "With the recent developments, we have managed to slightly reduce the demographic decline in the short term. Despite this, some people in the governments are suggesting more radical and controversial measures; this could result in drastic, but potentially good, effects in the country. In order to push these reforms into effective laws, we would also need a large support, which we can obtain from the nationalist parties.\n\n Furthermore, part of our Liberal partners will be lobbed by the industrial corporations and economy minister Kirihara; granting us a large space of manoeuvrer. Eventually, these are going to be, without doubt, very unpopular laws and a certain degree of civil resistance is expected in the first months... which will be met by a muscular response from the State and the national police."
JAP.2.a:0 "Do you think I'm giving in to those idiots!?"
JAP.2.b:0 "Desperate Times Call For Desperate Measures."

JAP.3.t:0 "The New Middle East"
JAP.3.d:0 "Geopolitics have been a thorn in Japan’s side for much time, since our terrible defeat at the hands of Russia in 20th century and the rise of Britannia. Our nation is the only true democracy in the middle of Asia as we are constantly squeezed by our colossal neighbours. As a result of this, total neutrality has been the best choice to preserve the nation’s existence until the new millennium.\n\n The balance of power is weak though, and new tensions are rising through the ironically called “Pacific Ocean”, as well as instability in United Europia and the Middle East. Eventually, the massive deposits of Sakuradite in Japan’s territory could be our curse if we don’t play our cards wisely, since they represent a powerful geopolitical tool against the superpowers. Furthermore, they have already proved their usefulness for the revival of the national economy and its transformation into an export-based system."
JAP.3.a:0 "It's A Dangerous Waltz"


JAP.4.t:0 "Operation Archer"
JAP.4.d:0 "Times are changing. \n\n Since the Philippine War, Britannia has been performing aggressive manoeuvrers near our territorial waters and has increased its hostility towards China and EU. Furthermore, after the renouncement of our neutrality policy, we must be ready to face serious possibilities, including the worst scenario: a war with one of the three superpowers. Our military forces are in an inadequate situation to fight an actual war and we cannot fully trust even China or EU to come for Japan’s safety. \n\n As a result of this, Interior Minister Sawasaki has authorized Operation Archer, the plan to prepare the nation for a future war with a series of quick reforms both in domestic and foreign policy. Interestingly, the plan was created decades after the First Pacific War, but nobody expected an actual implementation of it and we must keep it a secret from unwanted eyes. \n\n Eventually, we are probably going to put into place a partial part of Operation Archer, since many sections would require months or even years to be completed and we can't spare any additional time."
JAP.4.a:0 "Our Future Is At Stake Now"

JAP.7.t:0 "Exploiting The Markets"
JAP.7.d:0 "After the recent incidents in the Middle East, the foreign demand for our Sakuradite has just skyrocketed and numerous countries are quickly offering their money to Japan. Economics Minister Kirihara and Prime Minister Kururugi have thought of a risky plan to take advantage of this situation in order to assure an economic boom before the end of this year. In particular, we will offer very favourable conditions to foreign investors and companies by applying business-friendly measures in the resource market, such as lower tariffs and taxes. \n\n Furthermore, we are going to stipulate important treaties with all three superpowers to gain large loans, in exchange for cheap Sakuradite exports; obviously, we’ll promise unrealistic advantages to every superpower and it’s probable that a financial bubble will begin to form soon. Eventually, to avoid great troubles we’ll be forced to figure out a plan to play EU, China and Britannia against each other and destroy the financial bubble to guarantee further economic prosperity. Indeed, we have to be careful in this international stake."
JAP.7.a:0 "We rely on Kirihara and Kururugi"

JAP.6.t:0 "Cracking The Markets"
JAP.6.d:0 "We’re running out of time and this could be the right moment to make a decisive move in the markets. \n\n Despite this our government has become divided over the best choice to solve the situation. In particular, Economics Minister Kirihara and the corporations are leaning towards a further procrastination with the superpowers and, at the same time, the maintenance of our business-friendly policies. In this way, they believe Japan could obtain the maximum profits in the shortest time possible. \n\n On the other hand, Prime Minister Kurugi and his supporters are pushing for a quick ratification of the treaties, which will be revised to ensure an almost equal treatment for China and EU, and a new statal intervention in the economy. \n\n Despite this, the previous options are considerate too dangerous by a smaller third faction, Interior Minister Sawasaki and the bureaucratic apparatus. They think the safest position is to pull out, before it’s too late, from any international treaty with the superpowers and regulate the resource market to make a compromise between Laissez-Faire and Statism.\n\n This is the moment of truth, since it’s uncertain which will be the road to success or the fall into a disaster."
JAP.6.a:0 "Kirihara may have a point after all..."
JAP.6.b:0 "Kururugi knows what he's doing."
JAP.6.c:0 "Sawasaki has proven his competence."

JAP.8.t:0 "The Bubble Has Bursted!"
JAP.8.d:0 "After weeks of procrastination, something unexpected happened. The three superpowers brought Japan under the International Court of Trade for its inconclusive behaviour and forced the government to instantly repay large quantities of cash and good, such as Sakuradite. This prompted a cascade effect into the economy, since high taxes were introduced on workers and companies alike to avoid complete bankruptcy.\n\n Successively, the united effect of both long strikes inside the construction sites and the inability of the government to assure a future payment, or even the completion of the new Sakuradite refineries, provoked a massive escape of foreign investments and cash. Eventually, many companies collapsed and the resource market took a heavy toll, which was transmitted to other sectors of Japan’s economic and financial sphere. Ironically, we have embraced the road we tried to avoid at all costs. "
JAP.8.a:0 "Go To Hell, Kirihara!"

JAP.9.t:0 "The Bubble Has Been Conquered!"
JAP.9.d:0 "After weeks of unsettling talks with the superpowers, Prime Minister Kururugi and Foreign Minister Masaka have reached a solution of compromise with China and EU for Sakuradite exportation and, most importantly, the extension or increase for indefinite time of the generous investments into the country.\n\n These compensated and even exceeded the losses caused by a re-adjustments of various labour laws, thanks to a decisive state intervention against the so-called “fiscal paradises”. Furthermore, the opening of new Sakuradite refineries or the discovery of new deposits has guaranteed a constant influx of money into the government’s pockets. \n\nAs a result of this, we are facing a new expansion of the resource market, as well as a trade boom in Asia, which is carrying the other financial sectors; plus, the purchase power of the common people has increased with lower taxes on consumer goods. Eventually, we have just entered a virtuous economic cycle which will last for many years."
JAP.9.a:0 "We Made It, Kururugi!"

JAP.10.t:0 "The Bubble Has Been Avoided!"
JAP.10.d:0 "After weeks of talks with the International Court of Trade and the superpowers, the government has quickly pulled out Japan from any predatory deal, before it could provoke an international stand-off and doom Japan into an economic crisis. As a result of this, part of the funds and investments has been retired by foreign companies. Successively, Sawasaki and his bureaucrats managed to retain stability in the resources’ refineries with a package of trinket protections and subsidies to the workers.\n\n Eventually, a sufficient number of money have been saved from the Sakuradite extraction to barely compensate the absence of lucrative trade deal with foreign countries. Furthermore, it’s expected a quick ending to any radical initiatives and simple return to the status quo."
JAP.10.a:0 "You Are A Lucky Bastard, Aren't You?"

JAP.5.t:0 "Multiple Earthquakes Strikes Kanto!"
JAP.5.d:0 "It was an ordinary day for the citizens of Tokyo, until a sound they knew almost too well, began to fill up almost every neighbourhood in the city - A seismic alarm.\n\n  On 2:00 a.m; A number of seismic waves were registered through the Kanto region, but thanks to a pre-emptive communication by the Earthquake Central Department, the government was able to evacuate most people from the area. Furthermore, the damages, although severe, were successfully contained within localised zones and the emergency structures offered a valuable help during the process.\n\n Despite all efforts, a number of people couldn’t escape the earthquake and were killed before any possible intervention. Eventually, the incident continued for a limited period of time and the government has already stabilised the situation."
JAP.5.a:0 "We Must Help Our People!"

JAP.11.t:0 "Britannia Is Attacking!"
JAP.11.d:0 "Despite all previous measures we have taken against Britannia, such as the global blockade and the Sakuradite stand-off, the Empire has decided to attack our nation. EU and the Chinese Federation are paralysed and, apart surprises, they won't come in our direct support; Japan stands alone, fighting the Britannian war machine. In particular, the presence of the new terrifying weapons, the Knightmares, has already heavily demoralized our soldiers and officers.\n\nIt'd all be decided within 24 hours, so today, the might and honour of the Japanese must drive back the imperial aggressors, or we will be all doomed."
JAP.11.a:0 "Tenno Heika, Banzai!"


news.4.t:0 "The Second Pacific War"
news.4.d:0 "The common assumption, around the world, that Britannia wouldn't be so bold to attack Japan and risk a full-scale global war among all three superpowers, was wrong.\n\nCharles zi Britannia, Emperor of Britannia, blindsided the other factions by sending all Knights of the Round, the military elite of the empire, to Africa and India, and deploying his flagship, the Great Britannia, to the Indian Ocean. While all eyes turn away from the Pacific, the invasion began.\n\nEU and the Chinese Federation are paralyzed and Japan has to fight back, alone, the new terrible weapon deployed by the empire, the Knightmares. Eventually, many believe that Japan stands very little in front of the superpower, and only a miracle or much luck is going to avoid its total annihilation."  
news.4.a:0 "Another Britannian War?"

JAP.12.t:0 "Kururugi Speaks!"
JAP.12.d:0 ""...and eventually, I invite every single Japanese citizen, regardless of social position, gender or age, to actively participate in the war effort, no matter the cost! All people will begin actions of sabotage, struggle and disturbance against the Britannian plague, in the millenary spirit of an independent and holy Japanese nation! Yeah, that's right, Japan or Death!"\n\nWith these words Kururugi finished his message to the country, as he was evacuating Tokyo to a secret location, along most of his ministers and government officials. The Britannians were indeed an instoppable plague and nearly fifty percent of the frontline was either collapsing or in retreat, although Kururugi believed this could be his last chance to save the situation. Only time would have told..."
JAP.12.a:0 "Point of No Return."



JAP.13.t:0 "Britannia Offers Truce!"
JAP.13.d:0 "Due to the radical and brutal resistance of our army and citizens in the recent months, we have managed to slowly halt Britannia's war machine. We have taken massive losses in the process, but it appears the strategy actually worked, despite the initial opposition. Prime Minister Kururugi is glad to announce that Britannia has offered a peace deal to end the bloody conflict, while all the government breath a sigh of relief.\n\nFurthermore, there are some elements, especially in the Army, who don't seem to appreciate the deal, as it will give all Sakuradite and concessions to Britannia."
JAP.13.a:0 "Japan Is Not Yet Lost!"

JAP.15.t:0 "Partition of Japan"
JAP.15.d:0 "This is a disaster, Japan is being attacked from all three superpowers at the same time!\n\nSome weeks ago, Kururugi and his government were hoping for a truce with Britannia, considering the heavy losses, but this didn't happen and, instead, Charles decided to continue the war until the very end. EU and especially China, after some considerations, decided to intervene in order to avoid a complete take-over of the nation by Britannia. Although they pretend to execute an humanitarian intervention, Kururugi thinks that this will be the beginning of a partition of Japan among the superpowers.\n\nAs we are talking now, the Chinese army is advancing behind our back and soon the entire front will collapse; the only thing we can do now is to decide which side we should surrender first to."
JAP.15.a:0 "Japan Is Lost.\n(Play Chinese Japan)"

JAP.14.t:0 "Death of Prime Minister Kururugi!"
JAP.14.d:0 "This is truly the end, Prime Minister Kururugi was found dead in his isolated shelter by Interior Minister Sawasaki and various government officials!\n\nKururugi was with his son Suzaku and, apparently, a strong quarrel turned violent, as the boy was found staring at his father's body with various stains of blood all over his hands. As soon as the Ministers realized what happened, they fell into despair and shock.\n\nAfter few hours since the accident, it's reported that various Ministers are escaping from the nation, mainly to Asia and China. Furthermore, the entire administration is breaking down through all Japan and the army is being crushed from all fronts by the Britannians. The official resistance is slowly eroding itself and the last remnants of Kururugi's  cabinet are deciding, along Kirihara and the corporations, the possibility of an unconditional surrender.\n\n May God Save Japan."
