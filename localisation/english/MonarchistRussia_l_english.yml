MRU_create_the_senate_desc:0 "With his graciousness and mercy, the Tsar has agreed that the restoration of the Duma is necessary to sustain our God given duty to the people of the Motherland.

MRU_form_the_regency:0 "Appointing a Regent"
MRU_form_the_regency_desc:0 "With this action, the people will be reminded of one of our greatest Tsars; Peter the Great, as he too had his military appointed as his regent.

MRU_crisis_of_authority:0 "Regency Take Over"
MRU_crisis_of_authority_desc:0 "Even though the Tsar is considered the rightful ruler of the empire; we must avoid the possibility of reliving the disastrous rule of Nicholas II.

We shall appoint the regent to take this role and avoid the disaster from happening again."
MRU_young_ruler:0 "Young Ruler"
MRU_young_ruler_desc:0 "The Tsar, despite being young, is still royalty and the head of state. The people that dare question his illegitimacy are foolish to try and deny him his right to rule.

MRU_anti_popular_mandate:0 "Sharpen Our Claws"
MRU_anti_popular_mandate_desc:0 "Our power must be cemented into the hearts and minds of the people; for it is our God given right to rule, and we shall answer to no one.

MRU_crush_opposition_desc:0 "Our power must be cemented into the hearts and minds of the people; for it is our God given right to rule, and we shall answer to no one.

For a plague that is to spread within our people, shall lead them astray from their true purpose."
MRU_the_new_hierarchy:0 "Proper Echelon"
MRU_the_new_hierarchy_desc:0 "With the government finally made pure, we can re-establish the old hierarchy.

MRU_the_theocracy:0 "Church and State"

MRU_guard_the_cities:0 "People's Army of Komuch"
MRU_guard_the_cities_desc:0 "With civil war on the horizon, it is clear that there are traitors amongst our people.

As such we must raise a levy army of loyalists to combat this threat..."

MRU_instruct_imperial_guard_to_train_recruits_desc:0 "It has become clear that, though the imperial guard is our most elite army, we are lacking further manpower if we are to go to war with the invaders and traitors.

MRU_develop_plan_for_return_of_capital_desc:0 "It is well known that the true capital of Mother Russia is Saint Petersburg, or Petrograd.

MRU_increase_steel_production:0 "Blood and Iron"
MRU_increase_steel_production_desc:0 "Otto Von Bismark once said, that “The great questions of the day shall be decided with blood and iron.” We should take this literally, to solve the great question of the lack of resources.

#Section 3
MRU_Problems_of_free_Russia:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
MRU_Problems_of_free_Russia_desc:0 "The belief of separate republics is based on a false hope of “Equality” and “Freedom”.

With that said an old face may yet help us find a middle ground. \n Vyacheslav Molotov"
MRU_Forget_the_revolution:0 "Our Common Ground"
MRU_Forget_the_revolution_desc:0 "With an open dialogue with the socialist leader established thanks to Molotov. A neutral meeting place has been chosen.

MRU_cooperation_in_industry:0 "Cooperation in the Economy"
MRU_cooperation_in_industry_desc:0 "The imperial army is as strong as the day we faced Napoleon's muskets.

MRU_cooperation_in_army:0 "Cooperation in the Army"
MRU_cooperation_in_army_desc:0 "The imperial army is as strong as the day we faced Napoleon's muskets. Although history would show we did not fight those battles alone, we had a coalition by our sides, now we are the ones being faced with a pan-european army.

MRU_Britannia_traitors:0 "The Lion's Den."
MRU_Britannia_traitors_desc:0 "During the great war, The Tsar stood tall. shoulder to shoulder with the great monarchs of the world but Britannia did not see us as equals, when the socialists rose up we had no aid, The unspoken truth that gods chosen would defend one another's right to rule, did not stand true, not when it benefited the Britanian empire at our expense."
MRU_Their_betrayal:0 "The Cobra Strikes"
MRU_Their_betrayal_desc:0 "Yet again Charles shows his disregard for the divine right of kings. As we rose to acclaim our empire. The Bratannians placed a pretender in our east.

Yet again but for the last time."
MRU_use_RUS_nationalism:0 "Pride And Purpose"
MRU_use_RUS_nationalism_desc:0 "The socialists have become useful to us. It is not unknown that there are still quite a significant group of them in the Empire.

With the Reds to the East and the French invaders to the West; we must call on the monarchies to the south for any volunteers they can spare to the Empire. In return, we can temporarily give the Middle Eastern Kingdoms oil rights in the Caucasus. It will be a small price to pay, for victory."
MRU_Experience_exchange:0 "Devil's Contract"
MRU_Experience_exchange_desc:0 "With the Socialists now covering the Britannian invasion of the homeland, it is time that both armies exchange combat doctrine, if we are to survive as a nation.

A means to an end to the threat of foreigners."
MRU_the_FIRST_test:0 "Our First Trial"
MRU_the_FIRST_test_desc:0 "We have done everything to prepare ourselves for the war. The so-called “European Union Intervention Zone” Shall now know the price for daring to invade our motherland.
