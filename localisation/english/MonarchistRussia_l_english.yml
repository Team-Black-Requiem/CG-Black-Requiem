MRU.14.t:0 "Patriachs Speech"
MRU.14.d:0 "The crowd held its breath, waiting in anticipation of the ArchBishop walking behind the podium; microphones sitting in every square inch of the church, so that way, not one word would be missed to the Russian ears. The sound of footsteps, echoing slowly and thundering with the power of God solidified with every step. The trueing of papers knocking against the wooden podium, as the Archbishop clears his throat. \n\nIn the Ancient land of Judea, God had commanded Samuel to find a new king, to rid the land of the tyrannical king that was Saul. It was decreed that because God had seen David’s love for God and his chosen people, his dynasty will be forever cemented as King of Kings. I stand before you proclaiming, with the sole authority of the Lord, which he has granted before me, that God has given us our King of Kings. Vselvolod Romanov has returned as the rightful heir to the Empire, as God has given unto him as his birthright. Even when King David was exiled by King Saul, he still retained the greater love of God, than he did with the King that the man had crowned. For no man can know the true love of God, only God can know the true love that he gave his people. I can never know the true blessing that our Tsar has given us, with his return, to us. As we owe a great debt and loyalty to God, we also owe a great debt and loyalty to his chosen pupil, which is why I implore you, children of our Lord, to swear an oath of loyalty to our Tsar, who is our rightful leader. \n\nWith the land now consumed with fire and death; after breaking free from the shackles of tyranny, our enemies are numerous throughout the continent. Indeed, God always knows that the righteous will always be outnumbered by the heretics; even as our own people are blinded by the temptations of Republicanism, Socialism, and Britanianism; it is a testament that this is the age of trials and tests. Our Tsar has been through the test. He has been exiled by Republicanism, hated by socialism, and restricted of his birthright by Britanianism. And yet, he stands before us today, in triumph as our rightful leader. We are not worthy of having such authority and righteousness that the Tsar offers wholeheartedly; however, it is because that God is loving, and the Tsar is just, both has deemed us as deserving of his love, he gives us the authority and righteousness that he himself possesses. \n\nThere are those, who might still be confused with what I say and proclaim before you, and even if I try to explain the Lord’s plan it can never truly lift the fog of ignorance from our eyes. Which is why, I would like to offer our glorious Tsar to speak before you, and make the blind now see."
