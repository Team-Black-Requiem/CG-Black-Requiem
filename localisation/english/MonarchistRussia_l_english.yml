MRU.1.t:0 "An Empire in Crisis"
MRU.1.d:0 "Long ago, the Tsars ruled the land with justice and honor. These were traits that every Russian holds near and dear to their identity as a people. For 500 years, the land prospered towards the future; with the people loyally at Tsars beckon and call. However, European powers invaded the homeland, taking by force what they could not claim by right. Our people fought to the last, only to have our statesmen betray our people and play the harlot for the French. The idea of a prosperous future fell apart right before the Russians. Bastardizing our righteous past, they established a Republic, headed by heinously corrupt men and women with vile morals. Our people suffered immense hardship; poverty and starvation was rife throughout the nation. Unemployment skyrocketed, as executive dysfunction surged through our hardworking people; famine spread throughout our fields, forcing them to work on empty stomachs. /n/nThe people need strong authority and direction once again. Republicanism proved itself as weak and stagnant. The politicians who run our country are apathetic to our people and do not care about the spirit, nor the body of Russia. We watched and prepared
tirelessly for this day, or at least we thought. We didn’t realize that the people would see us as another facade rising up against the Republic; no different than these so-called Socialists who only spout dreams that only idiotic fools can believe can be made a reality. Even the Brittanians, who thankfully granted refuge to the tsar have decided to invade our homeland and install an illegitimate leader onto the throne. Our faction is the only path that leads to our restoration, for any other will only see our final complete destruction of the land. We have no more second chances. We must act now."
MRU.1.a:0 "THE EAGLE SHALL FLY ONCE MORE!!"

MRU.2.t:0 "Oberon and Titania"
MRU.2.d:0 "With the sounds of engines roaring in the air, the plane had taken off from Salekhard airport to make its way to the treacherous land of Britannia. The mission was a difficult task; to find the last true heir to the throne of Russia, and plan out the possible exits for the young exile to return home and reclaim his birthright. The long hours of the night would brighten the sky with all the stars of the universe, shining the pathway brightly to God’s chosen leader. In the very back of the plane was first class, holding two people only. A slim silver haired man had just lit his cigarette, filling the air with thick smoke; setting the stage for one of the greatest espionage operations at that time. The latter of this partnership, a brunette woman with intense copper eyes, sat in front of him with a table in between. With a simple wave of her hand, smoke began to depart away from her, with her eyes focussed on the picture on top of the file .The case file, aptly codenamed Puka, was layered with papers detailing all the current information on his whereabouts. Beside it was a map of the vast northwestern forest, just south of what used to be “Canada”. /n/n 
While the man wore a typical business attire, one typically used in the line of marketing and finance; the woman wore a casual dress, commonly seen among all young women of lower wealth. The contrast between them, though visible to the naked eye, are not as obvious as one would think. Both of them were carefully studying each line of words to the fine print; even the maps of forest were divided up equally into quadrants, highlighting every possible location of importance. After hours of carefully examining every document in scrutinous detail, the man leaned closer towards the woman while interlocking his hands together. /m/m“Remember Titania, you’re my beloved wife. We’ve been married for 10 years, and are waiting for our cousins to pick us up at the airport to drive us to our cabin in the northwestern part of the country. We simply are on vacation and will leave the country in 2 months. Are you able to remember this?” /n/n“I’m not some stupid amateur, Oberon. This isn’t my first time I had to hide from the public eye. I may be a loyal officer of the military, however; I’m so green that I will ruin the perfect opportunity to bring him back. Now more than ever,”"
MRU.2.a:0 " Bring home our beloved Puka, Brave Warriors"

MRU.3.t:0 "The Conference"
MRU.3.d:0 "The room had been lit by only the dimmest light bulbs they could procure from what was available; given the recent material restrictions that were imposed by the Republican government late last year but even though it was all they could get their hands on, the Conference could finally begin."

Refuse our rightful place in the continent. Then, we shall unleash such terrible vengeance, that generations unborn will cry out in anguish."

MRU.14.t:0 "Patriachs Speech"
MRU.14.d:0 "The crowd held its breath, waiting in anticipation of the ArchBishop walking behind the podium; microphones sitting in every square inch of the church, so that way, not one word would be missed to the Russian ears. The sound of footsteps, echoing slowly and thundering with the power of God solidified with every step. The trueing of papers knocking against the wooden podium, as the Archbishop clears his throat. \n\nIn the Ancient land of Judea, God had commanded Samuel to find a new king, to rid the land of the tyrannical king that was Saul. It was decreed that because God had seen David’s love for God and his chosen people, his dynasty will be forever cemented as King of Kings. I stand before you proclaiming, with the sole authority of the Lord, which he has granted before me, that God has given us our King of Kings. Vselvolod Romanov has returned as the rightful heir to the Empire, as God has given unto him as his birthright. Even when King David was exiled by King Saul, he still retained the greater love of God, than he did with the King that the man had crowned. For no man can know the true love of God, only God can know the true love that he gave his people. I can never know the true blessing that our Tsar has given us, with his return, to us. As we owe a great debt and loyalty to God, we also owe a great debt and loyalty to his chosen pupil, which is why I implore you, children of our Lord, to swear an oath of loyalty to our Tsar, who is our rightful leader. \n\nWith the land now consumed with fire and death; after breaking free from the shackles of tyranny, our enemies are numerous throughout the continent. Indeed, God always knows that the righteous will always be outnumbered by the heretics; even as our own people are blinded by the temptations of Republicanism, Socialism, and Britanianism; it is a testament that this is the age of trials and tests. Our Tsar has been through the test. He has been exiled by Republicanism, hated by socialism, and restricted of his birthright by Britanianism. And yet, he stands before us today, in triumph as our rightful leader. We are not worthy of having such authority and righteousness that the Tsar offers wholeheartedly; however, it is because that God is loving, and the Tsar is just, both has deemed us as deserving of his love, he gives us the authority and righteousness that he himself possesses. \n\nThere are those, who might still be confused with what I say and proclaim before you, and even if I try to explain the Lord’s plan it can never truly lift the fog of ignorance from our eyes. Which is why, I would like to offer our glorious Tsar to speak before you, and make the blind now see."
MRU.14.a:0 "placeholder"

MRU.15.t:0 "The Tsars Speech"
MRU.15.d:0 "Standing up to the sounds of applause, echoing in this religious chamber; the Tsar in his glory, though as young as he may be, stands before the podium with the audience still cheering in his honor. With a politeful raise of his palm, to quiet the energetic crowd, he clears his throat as he grasps the paper copy of his prepared speech. This will be the very first speech, by a Romanov, ever recorded live. /n/n“My people. Sons and Daughters of Russia. Two years ago, I asked for time; not as your Tsar, but as your brother. And that time was granted by you. You. The strength in my arms, the holder of my dreams. For I know the pain and suffering that you all have gone through; for the disease, that is Republicanism, only brings a slow and painful death to those that believe in its temptations. For my forefathers, who had loved this nation, were forced to leave in disgrace as they were betrayed by those who called themselves, their brothers. For years, you worked on empty stomachs, slowly rebuilding our strength, our pride, and our nation. For that time has passed; for once again our banner soars over the winter palace. For on this day, I proclaim to you all; that our nation, our culture, and our people have finally been restored to what was owed. Never again shall we be subjugated by our enemies, for they now lie dead in our streets. Drenching our ancestors' graves with their blood, as I vowed four years ago. Our Empire shall be once again, a glowing beacon of hope for all of humanity. And most of all, a proud and glorious nation for all Russians throughout the entire world!"
