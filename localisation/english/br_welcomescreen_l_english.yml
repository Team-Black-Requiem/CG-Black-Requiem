 BR_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n  §YBlack Requiem§! incorporates a fork of §YRoad to 56§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nBR introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, BR introduces the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of twenty three races - §YPony§!, §YChangeling§!, §YGriffon§!, §YDeer§!, §YDiamond Dog§!, §YDragon§!, §YBuffalo§!, §YPolar Bear§!, §YPenguin§!, §YMinotaur§!, §YZebra§!, §YHippogriff§!, §YKirin§!, §YHorse§!, §YCamel§!, §YGiraffe§!, §YDonkey§!, §YAbyssinian§!, §YLlama§!, §YGargoyle§!, §YCentaur§!, §YYeti§! or §YUnspecified§!. Many races have their own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be manually changed during the game.\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Black Requiem, §YScientific Development§!, §YSociety Development§!, §YIlliteracy§!, and §YPoverty§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n§YSociety Development§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YSociety Development§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YIlliteracy§! represents how many of your citizens can read and write. Low levels of §YIlliteracy§! impose §RResearch§! and §RConstruction§! maluses. §YIlliteracy§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YPoverty§! represents how well-functioning your economy is. Low levels of §YPoverty§! impose §RResearch§!, §RRecruitable Population§!, §RIndustry§!, and §RMonthly Population§! maluses. Both of these can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, BR introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Gone-time 50-200% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their   §YBlack Requiem§! experience.\n\n\n\n  §YBlack Requiem§! provides a new, flavorful system of general, admiral and, for players with the La Resistance DLC, operative generation. Various nations will generate different leaders of different races depending on their circumstances. For example, a nation may have both pony and griffon generals, or use multiple namelists. This does not carry any gameplay changes."
