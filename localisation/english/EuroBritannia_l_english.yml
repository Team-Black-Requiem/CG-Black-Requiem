EUR_Second_Site_Add_Info:0 "The Novosibirsk Complex was the pride of the eastern side of the inter-ESA competition, having a raw aerospace manufacturing potential. The closeness of industrial centres to the Magadan Cosmodrome gave Krasnoyarsk an Edge over aerospace factories in Africa or Europe.

EUR_Third_Site_Add_Info:0 " The Ural's Space Belt is the informal name given to the collection of radio-telescopes, ground stations, relay dishes and radar's that run along the northern Urals. These sites have historically been developed by various private telecom companies, research institutions, military departments and universities who can't afford site costs in the ESA dominated Alps sphere. Though their is no formal main site unifying their administration shouldn't prove too difficult."
EUR_Fourth_Site_Add_Info:0 "The prized jewel of the Russian Space programme and their main contribution too the ESA, The Moscow Institute was at the forefront of rocket propellant research, having been involved in designing rocket engines for almost every ESA flight. In bitter competition with the Germans, the Moscow Institute was a vital part of the ESA programme. Along with being the research hub of Russia's rocket design it also provided designs for military based rocketry down to ATGM's."
