##Character Desc
POLITICS_LUKA_ZHUKOV_DESC:0 "Luka Zhukov is not your ordinary socialist, before becoming a revolutionary he was a psychologist living in the Chinese Federation, he joined the RSWP during a trip to Kazakhstan where he quickly rose through the ranks of the party, after an incident in Kazakhstan he would be involved in the RSWP's more notorious activities in service to the Kazakh oligarchs who hosted the exiled red army, shortly after he gained enough significance in the RSWP he formed the hardline jacobin faction of the party who advocate for revolution via bloodshed, during the 2008 party congress Luka would be sidelined by Ivan Bunin in favour of his daughter Sonya Bunin it is safe to say Luka did not take to kindly to that, nowadays his new hobbies include murder, manipulation, casual genocide and of course eating pet bears."
