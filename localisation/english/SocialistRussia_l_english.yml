##Character Desc
POLITICS_LUKA_ZHUKOV_DESC:0 "Luka Zhukov is not your ordinary socialist, before becoming a revolutionary he was a psychologist living in the Chinese Federation, he joined the VKP during a trip to Kazakhstan where he quickly rose through the ranks of the party, after an incident in Kazakhstan he would be involved in the VKP's more notorious activities in service to the Kazakh government who hosted the exiled red army and the VKP after their defeat in Russia, shortly after he achieved enough significance in the VKP he formed the hardline jacobin faction of the party which advocate for revolution via any means they deem necessary, during the 2008 party congress Luka would be sidelined by Ivan Bunin in favour of his daughter Sonya Bunin, it is safe to say Luka did not take to kindly to that, nowadays his usual hobbies include murder, manipulation, casual genocide and of course §teating pet bears.§"

Chinese recognition will likely result in China becoming more involved in supplying the Socialist Republic of Russia's military and economical needs this will certainly give them the upperhand in the war against their enemies but only time will tell."

SRU_Luka_Socialist_Flavour.1.d:0 "As the war drags on across the motherland, the Euro-Britannian forces inch ever closer to victory while the revolution crumbles before Luka’s very eyes. The capital is in utter chaos as the people's militias scramble to the defence of the motherland, but it is all in vain as the final victory is drifting ever closer into the enemy’s clutches. As the nation is on the very edge of total collapse Field Marshall Anton Makarov had organised the remaining population of Novosibirsk which was home to the most loyal comrades of the revolutionary cause to evacuate to Kazakhstan, Luka Zhukov orders what is left of the Revolutionary Guards to place explosives around Novosibirsk to ensure the city's infastructure does not fall into the hands of the enemy, as soon as he had given the order he and his closest advisors make their way to the last train bound for Kazakhstan. While Novosibirsk was being evacuated the military was ordered to stay behind and resist the enemy at all costs, infighting abruptly broke out between the Red Army and Cheka, after which the remaining Cheka forces used the underground network of tunnels used during the first Russian revolution by Socialist Guerillas. Before Luka got on the last train at the Novosibirsk train station Luka was wounded by a gunman identified to be local worker Boris Mikhaylov who exclaimed §tTraitor To Mother Russia§!. As he shot Luka three times, Luka was rushed on board the train and departed immediately, at this time it is unknown if Luka Zhukov had survived his injuries but the gunman is still at large."

news.9.t:0 "The Great Fire Of Siberia"
news.9.d:0 "Today news on the evolving situation in Russia has provided a glimpse into the war between Euro-Britannia and the Socialist People's Republic of Russia. Our sources say that the socialists' war effort has come to a grinding halt due to the collapse of the government's authority in the region which was caused by Novosibirsk being leveled into nothing more than ruins, when the Euro-Britannian forces entered the city the majority of it was burnt to ash with the surrounding skies turning a thunderous orange which could be seen as far as Pendragon and Paris, the city was derelict and there were very little people left within the city limits numbering around 75,000 civilians compared to the previous population of 1.1 million. Many bodies littered the streets of Novosibirsk which earned it the nickname the city of the dead by Euro-Britannian soldiers, with the heart of the Socialist cause now destroyed and occupied by Euro-Britannia the revolution has come crashing down on Russia, many are sceptical of the remaining Socialist holdouts but little is known of their true fate at this moment in history."
