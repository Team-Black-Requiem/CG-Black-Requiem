Its dominance lasted until the new millennium, in the form of the Main Battle Tank type; however, this status quo might change in face of Knightmares and lethal anti-tank weapons for infantry. Furthermore, alternative armoured vehicles, such as land cruisers, are emerging in the world stage."

Equipped with rocket engines to fly the crew away from the wreck, the contraptions were soon equipped with artificial legs to allow greater mobility.

Its Druid System plots the trajectories of incoming projectiles and shifts the shields accordingly, giving the Shinkirō the highest defensive power of any Knightmare Frame.
