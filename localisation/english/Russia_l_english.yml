After the Great War and the Russian revolution ended he would join the Russian civil service and work his way up the political ladder but the more he climbed the ladder of success he would begin to notice the systemic corruption of the Russian system of governance that plagued Russian society for some time, he swore he would clean up the system and ensure Russia would become and equal partner in the EU. Now he is president of Russia but can he solve the social strife and economic hardship that his country faces, or does destiny have something else in store for him?"

RUS_WALTZ_DESC:0 "Mother Russia has been suffering from turmoil since the French invasion and the subjugation of the Tsardom during the Great War. The instability that still shadows the Pro-European government looms over the vast expansive plains of Russia; extremist ideologies have rooted themselves in the Urals and Siberia. Russia and its people exist in a tumultuous time and there is a deep-rooted uncertainty among the populace on what the future of the nation will ultimately pan out to be, whether the Russian government manages to withstand the trials ahead or collapse into anarchy is unknown - as the threat of civil war has never been more prevalent."
