The task will be far from easy, though; Millions of Russians are growing frustrated about the pending economic crisis, and thousands of them, especially in the Far East, are looking at §RBritannia§! with admiration. §RSoviet sentiments§! have never fully ended in Siberia, with strikes and labour unions threatening our power, while §RNationalists§! and §RRightist Extremists§! are agitating the Ural region. §RVastness of Russia is horrifying, and we must not let it devour us.§!\n\n§RClick on Each Region To Show Local Decisions.§!"
