RUS_region_reform_category_desc:0 "Even after a decade of direct European rule, it seems that the Republic of Russia is shifting away from our control. The mixed Civilian-Military Council led by our appointed General Blanchet has, so far, managed to lightly stabilize the situation, and only a direct order from Paris has pushed the administration to finally attempt to implement radical reforms and solve the deepest issues in Russia. The task will be far from easy, though; Millions of Russians are growing frustrated about the pending economic crisis, and thousands of them, especially in the Far East, are looking at §RBritannia§! with admiration. §RSoviet sentiments§! have never fully ended in Siberia, with strikes and labour unions threatening our power, while §RNationalists§! and §RRightist Extremists§! are agitating the Ural region. §RVastness of Russia is horrifying, and we must not let it devour us.§!\n\n§RClick on Each Region To Show Local Decisions.§!"

### Events ###
RUS.1.t:0 "An Appointed Constitution"
RUS.1.d:0 "The current constitutional obligation that we are bound to is a disgrace to the motherland, the government has been in talks with the French and they have agreed to a revision of the constitution since it is outdated and does not serve the interests of the Russian people or Europia."
RUS.1.a:0 "We cast off the shackles that bound us"

RUS.2.t:0 "Clean-Hands Strategy"
RUS.2.d:0 "Chernov is a man on a mission, all his life he has been set on enforcing the laws of the state to full effect. He has identified the flaws with the current system and he has outlined his plan to clean up the government by having them accountable to an independent court who will root out the inherent corruption that plagues the republic. Chernov wants to restore the people’s faith in the Russian system."
RUS.2.a:0 "Chernov will cleanse the system"

RUS.3.t:0 "A More Balanced Economy"
RUS.3.d:0 "The economy is the main problem that is facing the nation, our people have been suffering with a decrease in living standards and the gradual shrinking of the national economy. We must balance the economy and prevent an economic collapse that will affect the nation’s stability."
RUS.3.a:0 "We need to balance the budget!"

RUS.4.t:0 "The Army And The State"
RUS.4.d:0 "Many people believe that the economy is the biggest issue that is facing the nation, but they are wrong, the economy does not keep the social cohesion of the republic nor does it keep the nation safe in times of civil strife. The army is the most important aspect of the state, it defends the motherland and its people in times of conflict and suppresses any sign of rebellion that arises."
RUS.4.a:0 "The military will get their funding"

RUS.5.t:0 "Russia Offers To Buy Our Blueprints!"
RUS.5.d:0 "We have received word from the Russian government about a request to buy old military blueprints to modernize their military, they specifically asked for army related blueprints, there is little risk involved in letting such old blueprints go especially to the Russians who have a very underdeveloped military."

RUS.7.a:0 "We shall completely reinvent war"

RUS.8.t:0 "Improving Our Finances"

Now that the hydroelectric station in Rybinsk is built the prerequisites have been cleared for a full scale expansion of Siberian industry."
RUS.9.a:0 "Government Approved"

RUS.10.t:0 "The Best Approach"
RUS.10.d:0 "The agency for anti-corruption in Russia is to serve as a body for keeping tabs on the corruption that is entrenched within the government and civil service. This will serve the needs of the independent court once established and work to purify Russia of the ills corruption has wrought on the nation. The government’s war on corruption is far from over!"
RUS.10.a:0 "Down with corruption!"
RUS.10.b:0 "Promoting State's Role In The Economy Should Be Enough."

RUS.11.t:0 "Simpler, And Smarter"
RUS.11.d:0 "Russia’s independent judicial court for anti corruption has begun proceedings to readjust in effect legislation to close the loopholes and simplify the legislation to be very specific and less vague. Once these pieces of legislation have been modified they will close all avenues for exploitation by corrupt officials and businesses. The war on corruption continues until the state is purified of all corruption."

russiaCW.1.d:0 "In the far eastern lands of Siberia a realm has manifested into an upstart nation with an aristocracy. This new realm is called Euro-Britannia and appears to be made up by former aristocrats who fled to Britannia after the Great War. They oppose the republic and its ideals; they seek to unite Eurasia under their domain."
russiaCW.1.a:0 "Down with these Imperialist Dogs!"

russiaCW.2.a:0 "Damn those Revolutionaries!"
russiaCW.2.b:0 "Workers of Russia Unite!"

russiaCW.4.t:0 "Old Glories"
russiaCW.4.d:0 "Again another separatist state manifests into reality, the Russian Principality has seized on nationalist sentiments in the regions west of the Urals and the surrounding areas. They have proclaimed Vsevolod Romanov as their leader, although he seems nothing more than a puppet to the powers at be that being the military. They seek to unite what was once lost to them during the Great War."
russiaCW.4.a:0 "Bloody Monarchists!"
russiaCW.4.b:0 "Glory to the Tsar!"

russiaCW.7.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Republic"

The instability that still shadows the Pro-European government looms over the vast expansive plains of Russia; extremist ideologies have rooted themselves in the Urals and Siberia. Russia and its people exist in a tumultuous time and there is a deep-rooted uncertainty among the populace on what the future of the nation will ultimately pan out to be, whether the Russian government manages to withstand the trials ahead or collapse into anarchy is unknown - as the threat of civil war has never been more prevalent."
