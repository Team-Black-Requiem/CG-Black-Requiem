news.1.t:0 "International Group NAR Condemns Britannia!"
   news.1.d:0 "Recently, the international human rights group known as NAR issued a statement condemning the policies that the Holy Britannian Empire have imposed on the Numbers—the subjugated native peoples living in Britannia's colonial areas. Specifically, the statement denounces the oppressive conditions reserved for the Numbers and urges a review of current imperial policy. The group became famous after a series of attacks on the Chinese Federation and its Eunuchs and from its support in several cases of corruption in the Euro-Universe. Given its reputation, it had been under surveillance by several intelligence services, but the Britannian Foreign Minister has just declared that the infamous NAR will be put under the category of terrorist organization.\n\nSurprisingly, Britannia has received a huge wave of criticism from around the world, but no concrete actions are expected from the other superpowers."
news.1.b:0 "Nonsense."
news.1.a:0 "They got what they deserved."

news.2.t:0 "Airstrike on Manila!"
   news.2.d:0 "A month ago, several airstrikes took place in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The bombings appear to have been carried out by the Holy Britannian Empire. Several international newspapers highlighted the devastation caused by the attack. This was also confirmed by journalists present in the country.\n\n According to a Japanese military officer, based on the scarring of the landscape, no efforts were made to reduce the collateral damage inflicted upon the native population. The country has close ties with the Chinese Federation, and a strong response from the superpower is expected. Despite this, it seems unlikely that a full-blown war will break out anytime soon."
news.2.b:0 "Only collateral damage."
news.2.a:0 "So much violence..."

news.3.t:0 "The Oriental Incident"
   news.3.d:0 "After the Britannian conquest of the Philippines, Japan, known for its rigid neutrality, decided to align its policy with the EU and the Chinese Federation. The two superpowers and their allies had applied enormous economic pressure on Britannia by blockading all of their ports and imposing various economic sanctions in an attempt to force negotiations over the situation in the Pacific.\n\nBritannia, to the surprise of many observers, responded with a quick, clumsy declaration and promise of retaliation. Many consider this a major international defeat for the mighty Britannian Empire, but Euro-Universe's cooperation with China is unlikely to continue after this..."
news.3.b:0 "They will pay..."
news.3.a:0 "Destroy all of these goods!"   #What does this mean? *the X-Files theme plays*

news.5.t:0 "The Fuji Truce"
   news.5.d:0 "To the surprise of the rest of the world, Japan has somehow managed to hold off the Holy Britannian Empire for much longer than anyone ever anticipated, although severe casualties are being reported from both nations. After months of brutal fighting, major parts of the Britannian political and military elite have pressured the government and nobility to sign a peace deal to avoid further losses.\n\nThe truce will contain favourable terms for Britannia as it will guarantee a large concession regarding Sakuradite extraction and the lending of numerous ports and strategic islands.\n\nUltimately, the war has resulted in deep destabilization for both countries, and international experts are worried that the repercussions might affect the rest of the world..."
news.5.a:0 "This is humiliating...!"
news.5.b:0 "The Britannian Lion has been defeated."

news.6.t:0 "The Division of Japan"
   news.6.d:0 "Few could have expected that the outcome of the Second Pacific War would be a second partition among the three superpowers. Japan has now been split into two rump states.\n\nAfter Britannia made the risky decision to continue the war despite several losses and a general stalemate, the EU and China especially have sent out an invasion force to avoid a complete Britannian takeover of Japan. The Chinese Army has established a de-facto military protectorate over southern Japan under the guise of humanitarian intervention, while Britannia has created a similar administration in the northern regions.\n\nTensions are high in the devastated country; a lot of Japanese officials, generals, and citizens have already begun flooding into southern Japan. This could create further chaos in the cities."
news.6.a:0 "The 'Setting of their Sun'."

BRT.1.t:0 "Empress Marianne Is Dead!"
   BRT.1.d:0 "This is a disaster!\n\nOne of the Empire's most important Empresses, known as the Lady Marianne, has been assassinated in the Imperial Palace of Pendragon, and all of her personal guards are dead. The attack was carried out in broad daylight, and the perpetrators are not yet known to the public, though many consider it a terrorist attack.\n\nMarianne was in the building with her two children, Lelouch and Nunnally Vi Britannia, who witnessed the entire scene. In particular, her youngest daughter, Nunnally, eventually lost her sight and use of both legs. The investigation has already begun under the authority of Cornelia Li Britannia, former head of the Royal Guards. The situation is very tense in the government, but the Emperor decided to cover the news in the initial moments."
BRT.1.a:0 "This could have been avoided..."

BRT.2.t:0 "Something Is Up"
   BRT.2.d:0 "After weeks of hard investigation, employing the best agents in the entire district, we discovered some connections between the murder and parts of the government itself. The hidden web also seems to connect to the Secret Order of Geass, a fanatical religious organization that has influence in the Royal Family. At this point, it is likely that the Order and corrupt guards within the palace are behind the assassination. Even if it is an internal plot, it would create a huge shock in the hands of the press and must be kept secret, at all costs."
BRT.2.a:0 "This is getting out of hand..."

BRT.3.t:0 "Dead End"
   BRT.3.d:0 "We were digging deeper and deeper into the Order of Geass and eventually some suspects were found within the organization. Despite this, we felt closely watched and one day it happened.\n\n While we were working in our office, Imperial Intelligence raided the facility. They were not alone, the police had already surrounded the entire place and agents were ready to arrest us. Soon, we were dismissed from the case, which was considered unsolved and archived.\n\n It seems that Emperor Charles, advised by senior Geass figures, ordered the complete closure of the case and the destruction of any evidence. At this point it is clear that the emperor knows much more than we thought, but it is useless to continue or even protest."
BRT.3.a:0 "Watch your back, dear detective..."

BRT.4.t:0 "Priorities"
   BRT.4.d:0 "Despite the fact that the case is now closed, the consequences of the aftermath are still present. In particular, the other two superpowers have noticed our weaker position and have taken a more aggressive attitude toward us. In addition, many tensions and fears have arisen in the royal government and the royal family itself. Now, we have to decide the area where our limited resources should go first."
BRT.4.a:0 "Prioritize the internal situation."
BRT.4.b:0 "Deal with the foreign threat."

BRT.5.t:0 "Operation Rolling Thunder"
   BRT.5.d:0 "After weeks of preparations, we are ready to launch an invasion of the Chinese-controlled Philippines. It is important to capture the entire archipelago quickly, so that we can outmanoeuvre the enemy and avoid a direct confrontation.\n\n Three main attacks will start from Area 10; in particular, the main armies will be on Palau, Guam, and Iwo Jima, with full naval and air support. In the end, future territories will be critical to the future expansion into the Pacific theatre of the great Britannian Empire."
BRT.5.a:0 "Start the operation."

BRT.6.t:0 "Escalation"
   BRT.6.d:0 "The operation is a complete failure.\n\n Although we have made several gains, the entire archipelago is not under Britannian control. The war is dragging on for too much time and the Chinese Federation has sent us an ultimatum. Surrender the island to the Eunuchs or face a total war. It’s important to highlight that the last option is very risky, since our military in the Pacific isn’t at full strength and the Knights of Rounds are busy in South America. After these considerations, Emperor Charles thinks that the risks are too high..."
BRT.6.a:0 "Continue the War!"
BRT.6.b:0 "Back down..."

BRT.7.t:0 "The Chinese Federation Retaliates!"
   BRT.7.d:0 "After our attack on the Philippines, it appears that the Chinese Federation formed a temporary alliance with the other superpower, the Euro-Universe, and pressured Japan to align with its interests. As a result of this surprising move, Britannia is now isolated from most of the world's trade due to numerous economic sanctions and embargoes. While this will greatly damage the Britannian economy in the short term, it could be an opportunity to achieve Imperial autarky and prove the greatness of the Homeland once and for all!"
BRT.7.b:0 "This was unexpected. Reorganize the budget with further austerity!"

BRT.8.t:0 "The Honolulu Proposal"
   BRT.8.d:0 "To our surprise, the prime minister found an interesting compromise with the European Union. In particular, he met with some Russian delegates in the Hawaii Naval Command to discuss the recent incident and improve the bitter relations between the two superpowers. The Paris government is ready to secretly loosen part of the trade blockade and allow limited trade relations. In return, we will give the Attu Island, where the EU has laid a claim several years ago, to the Russian Republic. Considering its position in the extreme north, it won't be an important strategic loss."
BRT.8.a:0 "Accept the resolution."
BRT.8.b:0 "Refuse the resolution."

BRT.9.t:0 "The Departure of Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally"
   BRT.9.d:0 "The Emperor has decided on a permanent arrangement for Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally; the children of the deceased Empress Marianne will go to Japan for an indefinite period of time. This move will be a useful way to turn Lelouch and Nunnally into political pawns and, at the same time, reassure the Royal Family. In addition, their safety will be assured in the Asian nation from the plans of any hitmen in the Imperial Capital, Pendragon. Eventually, they will be under the protection of Prime Minister Kururugi and his son, as we will tell the press that their trip is for educational purposes only."
BRT.9.a:0 "It is necessary."

BRT.10.t:0 "Total Victory Over Japan!"
   BRT.10.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves was a great success!\n\nIn few months, we have managed to crush any Japanese resistance with our new advanced weapons, the Knightmares. After ruthless fighting in the streets, the Japanese government finally surrendered, while Prime Minister Kururugi disappeared and the country was left in a state of chaos and anarchy. Furthermore, many officials escaped to our enemy, China, and numerous enemy Generals and Officers went into hiding.\n\nDespite this, large deposits of Sakuradite are now in our hand and we have shown our muscles to the world. Eventually, as we are forming Area 11, the authority of Charles and the Imperial family has been firmly consolidated and the future looks bright.\n\nAll Hail Britannia!"
BRT.10.a:0 "Establish the new Area."
BRT.10.b:0 "Establish the new Area.\n(Play as Area 11)"

BRT.11.t:0 "A Protracted Stalemate"
   BRT.11.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves is a partial failure, since our main force have failed to force Japan into an unconditional surrender and capture the major cities of the country. The war has already ground on for over half a year and many generals are worried that this swamp will draw resources away from other vital theatres.\n\nAlthough Emperor Charles wants to continue the war, Prime Minister Odysseus and other Ministers has proposed an alternative peace deal, that will grant us access to all Sakuradite mines along minor concessions. Eventually we must decide carefully, since that could be taken as an indication of weakness by the other great powers"
BRT.11.a:0 "We won't give up!"
BRT.11.b:0 "Demand a Truce."

BRT.13.t:0 "Movements in the Shadows"
   BRT.13.d:0 "V.V. was the first ally of Charles during the Emblem of Blood, and this granted him a powerful position in the current administration. Allowing him to retain a considerable freedom of manoeuvrer to do as he whims.\n\nCurrently, V.V. has been the main antagonist to Marianne's influence, representing a counter-force to her power. He remains the least vocal opponent, preferring an underhanded approach to avoid unnecessary attention. The Secret Services are always keeping an eye, though, and only the Emperor's order could stop any further investigation."
BRT.13.a:0 "Something's up."

BRT.14.t:0 "Memories of the Emblem of Blood"
   BRT.14.d:0 "Prior to Charles' ascension to the throne, a violent internal feud occurred within the Britannian imperial family. During this period, assassination and betrayals were frequented among members of the various claimants that eyed the throne. In addition, this era saw domestic instability at its peak throughout the Empire's history.\n\nThe situation was partially solved with the intervention of several noble families, who supported the succession of a strong leader that could put an end to the bloodshed, in exchange for the reduction of some of the nobility's power (albeit for a brief period) - And that leader was Charles."
BRT.14.a:0 "An Era To Forget."

BRT.15.t:0 "The Office of the Prime Minister"
    BRT.15.d:0 "Since our people were driven out of Europia and the Britannia line assumed the throne, it has been tradition for the First Prince, the heir of the empire, to occupy the position of Prime Minister. Unfortunately, it seems that First Prince Odysseus has been rather indecisive, allowing the nobility more leeway then strictly appropriate. It seems that this unfortunate state of affairs has persisted for too long. Today, a declaration has come from the Emperor that Odysseus is to step down in favour of one of his more competent siblings."
BRT.15.a:0 "Farewell, First Prince."
    
BRT.16.t:0 "The Struggle for Prime Minister"
    BRT.16.d:0 "With the First Prince's exit from the Office of the Prime Minister, the position second only to the Emperor sits empty. For many this is a rare opportunity, but two individuals stand out among the crowds of the royal court. Second Prince Schneizel and First Princess Guinevere possess significant spheres of influence and are in the best position to take the office. Doing so will certainly boost their chances to inherit the empire as Odysseus has severely weakened his position."
BRT.16.a:0 "The name of the game is Power"

BRT.17.t:0 "East or West?"
    BRT.17.d:0 "The Emperor has expressed a desire to expand the holdings of his empire. A future prime minister must choose a section of the world to conquer as our empire cannot comfortably maintain two fronts at the present time. East or West, it does not matter so long as the upcoming prime minister heeds the will of Emperor Charles zi Britannia!"
BRT.17.a:0 "East or West, our homeland is the best!"

BRT.18.t:0 "Flavours of Autarky"
    BRT.18.d:0 "As with most issues, Second Prince Schneizel and First Princess Guinevere have taken completely different directions regarding our system of economy. Guinevere has been swayed by major corporate interests; whereas, Schneizel has long been a promoter of a system driven by technological advancement. Should we favour a candidate or take a balanced path?"
BRT.18.a:0 "A new take on the economy?"

BRT.19.t:0 "The Grip of the Empire"
    BRT.19.d:0 "In order to maintain the cohesion of the Holy Britannian Empire, it has become necessary to root out parts of the system that may be working to our detriment. Our two candidates have been battling in the Imperial Court for days and currently there is no resolution."
BRT.19.a:0 "We must come to a resolution."

BRT.20.t:0 "A Clandestine Rendezvous"
    BRT.20.d:0 "We will send Guinevere as an envoy to Paris to convince their politicians that our intentions lie elsewhere. If we can allay their suspicion, we may be able to direct them against China."
BRT.20.a:0 "Détente?"

BRT.21.t:0 "A Future Proposal"
    BRT.21.d:0 "Second Prince Schneizel has floated the idea of marrying the young empress of China to our First Prince. A devious move to be certain, as this will pave the way to completely oust Odysseus."
BRT.21.a:0 "A cunning move."

BRT.22.t:0 "Two Sides of the Same Coin"
    BRT.22.d:0 "The Purist faction's influence cannot be understated and both candidates much approach them with care."
BRT.22.a:0 "Reduce their influence"
BRT.22.b:0 "Empower the Purists"

BRT.23.t:0 "A Measured Response"
    BRT.23.d:0 "The Prime Minister will be granted the authority to revive the area system. Schneizel desires to bring the Numbers into the empire more slowly; however, Guinevere is seeking a more... traditional response."

### Ideas/Traits ###
darwinist:0 "Social Darwinism Proponent"
   POLITICS_CHARLES_BRTT_DESC:0 "From the very beginning of Charles' reign, the government has idealised the doctrine of Social Darwinism. As such, the propaganda sector uses three main slogans: Competition is equality, Domination is peace, and Strength is justice. While these words inspire the soldiers of the empire and strengthen the power of the government, they also increase the popularity of the extremist faction, the Purists. Additionally, they also create a state of perpetual social tension between the various nationalities and social classes."
efficient_administration:0 "Efficient Administration"
   efficient_administration_desc:0 "The Britannian colonial administration is known to be one of the most efficient in the world with its centralized bureaucracy and tight military control. These facets ensure law and order are both being upheld in all territories whilst said territories are under development, ultimately to allow Britannian colonists to move and live there peacefully."
legal_segregation:0 "Institutionalised Segregation"
   legal_segregation_desc:0 "Abiding by the tenets of Social Darwinism, Britannia implemented a complex and brutal system of segregation and oppression to use against minorities. In Britannia's conquered territories, the original inhabitants are designated as the "Numbers", and their cultures are forcibly destroyed by aggressive policies of assimilation or, in the worst cases, ethnic cleansing. In general, they enjoy a much lower standard of living and are excluded from all public or private jobs as well as military careers."
militarized_academia:0 "Military-Led Academia"
   militarized_academia_desc:0 "The royal government is currently diverting a large number of resources and funds to implement Odysseus' proposal. This consists of the further expansion and modernisation of the armed forces, including innovative weapons and armaments."
extreme_stratocracy:0 "Strict Stratocracy"
   extreme_stratocracy_desc:0 "Britannian society is well known throughout the world for the rigid stratification of its citizens. They are divided by their lineages with little opportunity for change once placed into one of the various social classes within the civilian or military sectors."
aristocratic_families:0 "Tyranny of the Aristocracy"
   aristocratic_families_desc:0 "Many British aristocrats followed the monarchy into exile upon Napoleon's conquest of the home islands. After the creation and stabilisation of imperial institutions, these nobles formalised their influence in the Senate as it gave them their only means of limiting the emperor's power: the veto."
army_primacy:0 "Army Primacy"
   army_primacy_desc:0 "Britannia's deep-seated militarism influences its entire society and is often encouraged by Darwinist propaganda and the Imperial Press. The average military officer's career is usually privileged with an increased salary and a real possibility of entering the nobility, effectively increasing the officer's morale and, as a result, their overall productivity and efficiency."
financial_conglomerates:0 "Financial Conglomerates"
   financial_conglomerates_desc:0 "The Britannian economy is characterised by a series of powerful economic and financial conglomerates often controlled by noble families or retired generals. This fosters poor working conditions and an incredibly weak middle class."

### Focuses ###
## Starting Focus Tree ##
court_intrigues:0 "The Nobility's Subterfuge"
   court_intrigues_desc:0 "Decades have passed since the Emblem of Blood era ended, but infighting and hidden unrest have begun to emerge inside the Royal Palace once again, mainly due to the great influence that Empress Marianne has on the current government. Although Charles' iron fist put an end to the violent episodes of years past, it seems that won't be enough this time."
VV_situation:0 "The V.V. Situation"
   VV_situation_desc:0 "V.V., the highest priest and head of the Geass Order, is making strange moves behind the government's back. However, it's important to highlight that the Emperor is in close contact with him, so there shouldn't be too many problems with blocking any potentially dangerous accidents or situations."
BRT_assassination:0 "An Unexpected Death"
   BRT_assassination_desc:0 "V.V. has finally made his move. This will have incalculable consequences..."
BRT_evidence:0 "Close the Capital!"
   BRT_evidence_desc:0 "First, we need to shut down all access to the capital. That way, we can save face while blocking any witnesses from leaving Pendragon."
BRT_investigating:0 "Continue the Investigation!"
   BRT_investigating_desc:0 "A special team of detectives has been formed to solve the case, but we must keep an eye on them..."
BRT_case_unsolved:0 "Unsolved Case?"
   BRT_case_unsolved_desc:0 "The detectives have crossed a line they shouldn't have. They've uncovered too many of the imperial government's secrets. We must stop this investigation AT ONCE!"
BRT_continue_plan:0 "Contact the Prime Minister"
   BRT_continue_plan_desc:0 "After the accident involving the late Empress, we must stabilise the situation in the capital. Prime Minister Odysseus can help us with that."

# Left Path #
BRT_foreign_situation:0 "Confront the Chinese Federation"
   BRT_foreign_situation_desc:0 "In order to regain our power on the world stage, we could fight our rival, the Chinese Federation, in the Pacific. Despite their numbers, the Chinese Army isn’t ready for a surprise attack on their dominions in Asia."
BRT_bombings:0 "Airstrike Manila"
   BRT_bombings_desc:0 "The Philippines is one of the most exposed puppets of the Chinese Federation and, because of its location near Area 10 and the Britannian Pacific Fleet, also a perfect target. To cripple their military infrastructure and morale, we are going to launch a major airstrike on their capital, Manila, regardless of the number of civilians present. The Chinese Federation will surely have a slow response to this."
BRT_troops:0 "Border Conflicts With Japan"
   BRT_troops_desc:0 "We can initiate some border conflicts with Japan on the island of Ishigaki so they will not interfere in our affairs. Several Britannian patrolcraft are poised to fire warning shots at any Japanese fishing boats near the coast to distract their navy while we conduct our operation in the Philippines."
BRT_army:0 "Take the Philippines"
   BRT_army_desc:0 "The Philippines is one of the few territories that stand between us and the Chinese Federation. It must be brought under our leash as soon as possible in preparation for our campaigns in Asia."
BRT_oriental:0 "The Oriental Incident"
   BRT_oriental_desc:0 "After our operation in the Philippines, we received condemnations from every nation in Asia, and the most important ones have decided to embargo our goods and impose harsh sanctions on our trade. This is a disaster for our economy. We must act fast, or the consequences will be most severe."
BRT_protectionism:0 "Enact Protectionist Policies"
   BRT_protectionism_desc:0 "In order to defend the Britannian industry from a crash induced by the embargoes placed upon us, we must redirect our efforts towards our domestic economic situation. A package of protectionist measures will preserve the competitiveness of many companies, although it will be costly politically."
BRT_diplomacy:0 "Propose Negotiations"
   BRT_diplomacy_desc:0 "If we hope to restore our economy, we must open diplomatic negotiations with the Europeans. We can organize a territorial exchange of the Attu Islands in exchange for a secret trade of our goods. The northern islands are going to become part of Russia, but their strategic value for Operation Tidal Waves is insignificant."
BRT_aid_MON_rebels:0 "Aid Mongolian Rebels"
   BRT_aid_MON_rebels_desc:0 "Many ministers have proposed a strong reaction to the embargoes: the funding of several separatist groups in Mongolia. They will be reached using our connections from within the Kyoto House, the Japanese yakuza, and several Chinese triads." #This makes no sense as a response to embargoes. It would make much more sense if placed before the Philippines invasion to serve as a distraction for the Chinese Federation to help further create the illusion of their slow response.
BRT_block_sup:0 "Flex Our Military Might"
   BRT_block_sup_desc:0 "In this key moment, it is crucial to remind the other superpowers of what we are capable of if their aggressive stances go too far. The Knights of the Round are perfect for this role. They will be deployed in strategic zones in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans."

# Middle Path #
BRT_domestic_front:0 "Manage the Domestic Front"
   BRT_domestic_front_desc:0 "In order to further stabilise the nation, the Prime Minister has suggested a number of measures to counter internal troublemakers and hidden threats."
BRT_reassure_family:0 "Reassure the Royal Family"
   BRT_reassure_family_desc:0 "Lelouch and Nunnally, the children of Marianne vi Britannia, are in an extremely dangerous position in Pendragon and, after Lelouch’s ridiculous request, must be sent to Japan as bargaining tools. As members of the royal family, they will be under Kururugi’s protection."
BRT_control_purists:0 "Sideline the Purist Faction"
   BRT_control_purists_desc:0 "The Purists have just acquired a dangerous amount of popularity amongst the imperial soldiers, thanks to the Marianne affair. They currently pose a danger to the crown. They must be sidelined from Britannian politics, for now."
BRT_nobility_ties:0 "Reaffirm the Nobility's Dominance"
   BRT_nobility_ties_desc:0 "It’s important to reaffirm the dominance of the nobility within the Britannian political system and support the mighty families of Pendragon who had helped us multiple times during the Emblem of Blood era. This will weaken the radical factions while boosting the oligarchic financial conglomerates."
BRT_laziness_odysseus:0 "Sway the Prime Minister"
   BRT_laziness_odysseus_desc:0 "Despite his initial commitment in response to Marianne's death, Prime Minister Odysseus has been becoming lazier by the day. We need to have a little "talk" with him to ensure his active participation in state politics."

# Right Path #
BRT_KN_dev:0 "Continue Knightmare Development"
   BRT_KN_dev_desc:0 "Even before Marianne's death, our scientists were experimenting with Sakuradite to create powerful weapons called "Knightmares" that will present us with an enormous advantage over our enemies. The research is complex, though, and will still require some time to complete."
BRT_KN_module_1:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 1"
   BRT_KN_module_1_desc:0 "We have created an emergency cockpit to serve as the base for our Knightmares. It is equipped with a rocket engine so that the pilot may fly to safety should their Knightmare be destroyed. There isn't much room to move around inside as a result of the added safety equipment, but the benefits of this design heavily outweigh the drawbacks. After all, every soldier saved will live to fight for us another day."
BRT_KN_module_2:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 2"
   BRT_KN_module_2_desc:0 "We have installed a set of wheels onto the legs of every Knightmare. We call this the "Landspinner Propulsion System". It will afford our Knightmares significant boosts to both mobility and speed whilst travelling by ground."
BRT_KN_module_3:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 3"
   BRT_KN_module_3_desc:0 "We have developed a sophisticated camera which we named the Factsphere Sensor. Its purpose is to transmit thermographic data directly to the pilot. It utilises a wide variety of hardware to provide the pilot with an extensive web of information regarding their enemies, their allies, and their surroundings."
BRT_KN_ashford:0 "Help From the Ashford Family"
   BRT_KN_ashford_desc:0 "The Ashford family have always been loyal allies to our government. Currently, they are managing a fairly efficient research institute which we could use to properly develop Knightmares. With their assistance, we will finally be able to create a proper Knightmare module to standardise into our army."
BRT_KN_old_guard:0 "Fight the Old Guard"
   BRT_KN_old_guard_desc:0 "Several old generals, including our current chief of army, are still opposing the creation of Knightmares. They rely on traditional tactics and consider Knightmares to be out of the realm of fantasy and, as a result, a waste of resources. If they refuse to see past their preconceived notions, we have no further need for them. Therefore, by direct order of Emperor Charles zi Britannia, they must be sidelined."
BRT_KN_glasgow:0 "Glasgow's Deployment"
   BRT_KN_glasgow_desc:0 "At last, we have managed to merge all of our newest technologies together to create a reliable Knightmare unit! After we integrate them into several of our army divisions, we will finally be ready to confront Japan and its protectors. This technological feat signifies a glorious day for our mighty empire. All hail Britannia!"

# Final Focus #
BRT_war:0 "Operation Tidal Wave"
   BRT_war_desc:0 "It is time to officially commence Operation Tidal Wave—the invasion and forced colonisation of mainland Japan. We must end this quickly lest we risk the other superpowers' intervention."


## Post-War Focus Tree ##
BRT_piece_empire:0 "A New Piece of the Empire..."
   BRT_piece_empire_desc:0 "Victory at last! That ugly stain on the face of the globe, Japan, is no more! Knight Bismarck Waldstein and the mighty forces of the Holy Britannian Empire have crushed all resistance! Integrating that morsel of land will be no trivial matter, however."
BRT_odysseus_resign:0 "...And Now an Empty Position"
   BRT_odysseus_resign_desc:0 "Crown Prince Odysseus eu Britannia has proven himself nothing short of a complete embarrassment to the Britannian Imperial Family. Luckily, stripping him of many of his responsibilities is an easy matter, and by sidelining him, the ferocious contenders encircling his imaginative throne can squabble bitterly over the scraps. "
BRT_struggle_begins:0 "Let the Struggle Begin!"
   BRT_struggle_begins_desc:0 "Power! Power! Power! Britannia is ripe for the taking! The board pieces have been arranged neatly; only the final touches remain for a theatrical performance of grand proportions! Second Prince and Prime Minister Schneizel el Britannia and First Princess Guinevere de Britannia shall become locked in a bitter struggle for the reins to authority."

BRT_diplomatic_field:0 "Diplomatic Upheaval"
   BRT_diplomatic_field_desc:0 "We have stirred the hornet's nest. Our ambitious invasion of the Japanese archipelago has done little to improve our international standing. As a response to our aggressive measure, both the Chinese Federation and the United Republic of Europia have declared their intent to respond in kind, raising the question of a possible worldwide conflict."

BRT_new_frontier:0 "The New Frontier"
   BRT_new_frontier_desc:0 "Across the shining sea, there is a dark and terrible monstrosity: a dragon that threatens to swallow up our newfound jewels, eager for the blood of our children. China—otherwise known as the Chinese Federation—is a very real hazard to our international initiatives. We must smother this flame before it engulfs us all."
BRT_reinforce_new_areas:0 "Defend Our New Areas"
   BRT_reinforce_new_areas_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that our Britannian ground forces are incapable of defending every square inch of our glorious empire. Our commanders have proposed that we rapidly expand the Britannian Foreign Legion to account for the severe shortage of able-bodied individuals."
BRT_paris_conference:0 "Paris' Secret Meeting"
   BRT_paris_conference_desc:0 "The United Republic of Europia should be 'reassured' about our intentions, placated whenever possible, and duped into thinking that they are 'safe' from our reach. Some accommodations might have to be made for the sake of our other interests, but these matter little. Once we have what we need, Europia will be swept aside with one swift stroke of a pen."
#Left > Right
BRT_lost_homeland:0 "The Lost Homeland"
   BRT_lost_homeland_desc:0 "Europia is a degenerative waste of fresh air; their self-destructive policies have set them on a collision course with the iceberg of fate. But fear not! We will bring to their morally bankrupt masses the greatest gift of life: the sweet release of death. When we do, we shall retake the land which is rightfully ours! But why stop there? Let us seize their land as well, just as they once did to us!"
BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet:0 "Fund the Atlantic Fleet"
   BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet_desc:0 "Our Atlantic defence fleet sits rusting away in our docks. We have neglected a crucial aspect of our global force projection, permitting our sailors to become lethargic. By appointing determined young naval officers to standings of tremendous responsibility, we will rejuvenate and adequately outfit this force for the next significant battle on the ocean's surface."
BRT_china_detente:0 "Détente With China"
   BRT_china_detente_desc:0 "Even if it pains us to our very core, we must reach a mutual understanding with the Chinese Federation. Highly publicized engagements between our ambassadors will do much to mend the gap between our two nation-states. If we utilize soothing, complicated words, surely we will scramble their biologically inferior minds to the point where they will agree with our terms on every subject."
#Left > Final
BRT_shuffle_foreign_minister:0 "Shuffle the Foreign Minister"
   BRT_shuffle_foreign_minister_desc:0 "We will never gain complete control over the foreign ministry with the current administration in place. We will have to dispose of the opposition—particularly the current minister—whether by persuasion or force. Once he's been cleared off the board, he can be sent into retirement with considerable luxuries at his disposal."

# Middle Path #
BRT_economic_field:0 "Economic Troubles"
   BRT_economic_field_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the international blockade of our waters has damaged our economic machine and left us vulnerable to outside influences. We must remedy this serious thorn in our side lest everything grinds to a halt. High-ranking officials have already begun concocting half-baked solutions, but it will be ultimately up to us to decide what path we shall take in the coming weeks, if not months."

BRT_favour_corporatism:0 "Favour Corporatism"
   BRT_favour_corporatism_desc:0 "What is that irritating noise? Our working class complains endlessly about their lot in life, assuming they have a right to the pursuit of happiness. What nonsense! Regardless, as their benevolent betters, we must furnish them with an inkling of self-respect. Restructuring the lowers rungs of our society into corporate groups will do much good in the future, or at least, we hope."
BRT_protectionism_thesis:0 "Protectionist Thesis"
   BRT_protectionism_thesis_desc:0 "A free market economy? We shall never allow such an aberration to exist within our borders! We will restrict the imports gathered from foreign nation-states, urging our state-owned companies to produce self-sufficiently. Of course, there will be some problems—nothing major to worry about, though. Our economic advisors have reassured us that this is the right path to take."
#Middle > Middle
BRT_mantain_balance:0 "Maintain a Balance"
   BRT_mantain_balance_desc:0 "Why the unnecessary changes when we already have all the pieces of the puzzle? Uprooting the organization of our society into corporate groups would be detrimental to the well-being of the state. Fortunately, it might be possible to avoid this by finding common ground with the reformist-minded paper pushers and the bumbling fools within our aristocracy."
BRT_discuss_state_role:0 "Discuss the State's Role"
   BRT_discuss_state_role_desc:0 "State interference in the economic sector has proven disastrous in the past, hence our strategic initiative to privatize a small part of that beast to enable domestic and foreign investors to utilise our shores for new markets previously left untouched. Once again, it is up to us to determine if we will follow a strict or lenient model following this course of action."

BRT_favour_technocracy:0 "Favour Technocracy"
   BRT_favour_technocracy_desc:0 "Change is necessary. We have let decadence, corruption, and—worst of all—incompetence plague every major facet of our economy. We must surgically remove the tumour that is nepotism before it is too late. Restructuring our government to be based upon merit rather than mediocrity is essential lest we risk fading into the annals of history."
BRT_take_key_positions:0 "Seize Key Positions"
   BRT_take_key_positions_desc:0 "We must manoeuvrer our supporters into the fledgling economic apparatus; every position from minister to foreman must be filled by those who have sworn allegiance to us and us alone.

BRT_economy_science:0 "What Is Science Without Economics?"
   BRT_economy_science_desc:0 "Our scientists are constantly complaining about so-called 'blunders' made by our economic advisory councils. Why can't they fall in line like their counterparts? We will submit their 'research institutions' to the will of our production ministries, tying them to the very thing they resent. Naturally, they will see the error of their ways and refrain from making disparaging remarks toward our trusted lieutenants."

BRT_shuffle_economic_minister:0 "Shuffle the Economic Minister"
   BRT_shuffle_economic_minister_desc:0 "The economic minister has proven most resistant to our desired changes. He will have to be dealt with. At this very moment, our operatives are showing him the 'error' of his ways. Following his resignation, he will have a heart attack, and his family will disappear from the face of the earth. Tragic, really, but it couldn't be helped given the solemnity enshrouding our economic endeavours."

BRT_political_field:0 "Political Skirmishes"
   BRT_political_field_desc:0 "It seems, however far-fetched, that our heavy-handed approach to the internal struggles within our empire has culminated in an all-out conflict between the myriad components of our governmental structure. We must deal with this problem hastily or else face widespread subversion from every corner. Time is of the essence."
BRT_purist_question:0 "The Purists Question"
   BRT_purist_question_desc:0 "Evil is rooted at the very centre of our empire, coiling around the hearts and minds of our best and brightest. We have carelessly allowed these monstrosities to stake their claims to the riches of our success. We must make a decision: the Purist Faction can either be allowed to purge this black stain or be crushed in favour of some alternative method. There is no middle ground."
BRT_areas_question:0 "The Areas Question"
   BRT_areas_question_desc:0 "Our regional establishment is a crumbling mess just short of a complete disaster. We have failed to satisfy even our basic long-term objectives. According to our most trusted representatives on the ground, brute force is no longer an option and will only aggravate the situation. Unfortunately, we might have our hand forced by variables outside of our control unless a drastic policy shift takes place."
BRT_cult_question:0 "The Cult Question"
   BRT_cult_question_desc:0 "Religious fanatics have been a threat to the integrity of the throne for far too long. Their superstitious nonsense has at last drawn the ire of our military commanders, high-ranking nobles, and scientific minds.

BRT_deal_guinevere:0 "Deal With Guinevere"
   BRT_deal_guinevere_desc:0 "The first order of business is to dispose of First Princess Guinevere, Schneizels most prominent opponent. While we cannot do anything to her directly as that would be far too obvious.

BRT_WALTZ_DESC:0 "The origins of Britannia can be traced back to the Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in a stunning victory for Napoleon. During the Napoleonic invasion of mainland Britain, many aristocrats and nobles escaped alongside the royal family to their dominions in North America.\nAfter the first few hard years, the new nation, inspired by the principles of Social Darwinism, consolidated into an absolute monarchy and gradually extended its rule across both continents. Eventually, the Britannian Empire became a global superpower after it made significant advancements in science and military technologies."

BRT_influence_EU_colonies:0 "Influence EU Colonies"
   BRT_influence_EU_colonies_desc:0 "While open warfare with the EU would be inadvisable at this time, we must ensure that we gain a foothold on the continent. Nigeria and South Africa, two of the EU's colonies, are prime targets for us to conquer with our overwhelming influence."
BRT_operation_orange:0 "Operation Orange"
   BRT_operation_orange_desc:0 "South Africa has long languished in the shadows of the EU, unable to prosper and move forward. This has fostered resentment amongst the population—resentment we can utilise towards our own ends."
BRT_reach_out_boers:0 "Reach Out to the Boers"
   BRT_reach_out_boers_desc:0 "The Boer people have long since wished for independence from the EU but lacked the means to fight such a war. While we cannot supply them openly with Knightmare Frames or similar technologies, we can supply them with basic weapons to fight against their 'oppressors'."
BRT_promises_greatness:0 "Promises of Greatness"
   BRT_promises_greatness_desc:0 "The people of South Africa are ready to revolt; they need but a small push to tip the scales forward. We will offer them promises of greatness under us, if—and only if—they help us fight against their former masters when the time comes."
BRT_declare_apartheid_compatible:0 "Declare Apartheid Compatible"
   BRT_declare_apartheid_compatible_desc:0 "The apartheid is one of the most important systems in South Africa right now, so much so that any opposition to it will only be met with rejection. If we promise to give them our support in upholding this system and assure them that Britannia is compatible with it, our relationship with South Africa will vastly improve."
BRT_joeannesburg_meeting:0 "Johannesburg Meeting"
   BRT_joeannesburg_meeting_desc:0 "It appears our efforts were not in vain. South African authorities wish to converse with us about what the future of South Africa will look like after the war is over and what kind of benefits we would exchange with them. This process will be a long one, but we already managed to gain military access to the South African kingdom in preparation for our future war."

BRT_operation_dark_anvil:0 "Operation Black Anvil"
   BRT_operation_dark_anvil_desc:0 "While Nigeria is not so open to dissent as the South African Kingdom, it is strategically located in an area useful to us and there are elements that either align with Britannia or oppose the EU in the country itself. We will slowly infiltrate it, and prepare a quick takeover of the country when the time is right."
BRT_infiltrate_bureucracy:0 "Infiltrate Their Bureaucracy"
   BRT_infiltrate_bureucracy_desc:0 "The Nigeria administration is greatly understaffed, and is lacking in manpower capable of performing the required tasks to run a country. A sudden influx of capable 'Nigerian' individuals will surely help to alleviate this problem."
BRT_influence_pied_noirs:0 "Talking To The Pied-Noirs"
   BRT_influence_pied_noirs_desc:0 "The Pied-Noirs were promised greatness and an Nigeria on par with other nations of the EU controlled by them as Europeans, and instead they are now a lowly colony in Africa. While they are sure to be somewhat suspicious of similar offers, we will approach them with the promise of the country becoming an Area, and the Pied-Noirs in charge of it under Britannia."
BRT_pull_in_companies:0 "Pull In Britannian Companies"
   BRT_pull_in_companies_desc:0 "Nigeria is languishing economically, with vast amounts of resources being diverted to Europia mainland while not returning anything to the nation which leaves the population dissatisfied and feeling dejected. Installing our companies into the country to boost it's economy, even at a loss for us, will surely gain us support from the population."
BRT_horse_troy:0 "Our Horses Of Troy"
   BRT_horse_troy_desc:0 "While openly still a loyal member of the EU, internally Nigeria is already ours. With the population looking to the other side, many leaders cooperating with us and our agents in key positions we are free to move our troops into the country, and prepare the surprise attack on the other colonies. Our very own horse of troy in Africa."
BRT_fund_russian_loyalists:0 "Fund Russian Loyalists"
   BRT_fund_russian_loyalists_desc:0 "Our push into Europia needs a breaching point, and our intelligence agency identified that Russia is in a precarious position. The loyalists are pushing for a free and independent nation, and a civil war just looming over the horizon. A little push from our funding towards these loyalists should start the process of sending the nation into a down-spiral."
BRT_send_monica:0 "Send Knight Monica"
   BRT_send_monica_desc:0 "With the loyalists now eager and funded, they are lacking in training and an effective plan. We do not have the time to slowly train their leaders up to par, so we will send Lord Monica in secret to guide them towards a path of our convenience."
BRT_stir_up_separatists:0 "Stir Up Separatist Tendencies"
   BRT_stir_up_separatists_desc:0 "While the loyalists are now ready, without the support of the people this plan will fall on it's face. We must stir the separatist tendencies of the population, push them towards an 'Independent Nation', so that the people of Russia throw themselves into this war willingly."
BRT_operation_white_bear:0 "Operation White Bear"
   BRT_operation_white_bear_desc:0 "Finally, with the support of the Russian population secured, it is time we ignite this civil war in full: The creation of Euro-britannia. Our continual support from behind the scenes will need to continue in order for our plans to come to fruition, but this is our first step in finally breaking Europia and retaking our homeland."
BRT_supply_euro_britannia:0 "Supply Euro Britannia"
   BRT_supply_euro_britannia_desc:0 "With the war between Euro-britannia and Russia raging without stop, the resources of Euro-britannia will not be enough to allow them to win this conflict. While risky, supplying them from behind the scenes is a necessity if we are to win this war."
BRT_undefined_soldiers:0 ""Undefined" Soldiers"
   BRT_undefined_soldiers_desc:0 "While we cannot officially join the war, nothing is stopping enterprising soldiers to ask for leave of absence and go to the Euro-britannian frontline to fight for what they believe. With such honourable intentions in their hearts, we will of course authorize these LoAs and send them with our blessings."
BRT_secure_supply_lines:0 "Secure The Supply Routes"
   BRT_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "The Euro-britannian troops are fighting valiantly, but their lack of training is obvious. Nothing shows this more than their disregard for protecting their own supply routes and attacking those of the enemies. Our troops will take on this burden to ensure victory."
BRT_winter_kn:0 "Improve Winter Knightmares"
   BRT_winter_kn_desc:0 "The knightmares that Euro-britannia 'mysteriously' acquired were never designed for winter warfare, and this is obvious if one analyses their performance in this war. We will improve these knightmares so that they can fight effectively."
BRT_goal_urals:0 "Reach The Urals"
   BRT_goal_urals_desc:0 "With the Russian resistance crumbling, we must set our aim towards our real next goal: The Urals.

BRT_green_light_china:0 "Green Light To China"
   BRT_green_light_china_desc:0 "We have received news that the Chinese federation plans to invade Europia, and that they want to cooperate with us in this endeavour. This temporary alliance has benefits we cannot overlook. We will begin talks with the Chinese Federation to set out plans for the future."
BRT_finalise_spartition_plans:0 "Finalize Partition Plans"
   BRT_finalise_spartition_plans_desc:0 "The Chinese Federation is willing to enter war on our side, but is asking for territorial partition once Europia collapses. Europia should be fully ours, but the benefits of the plan outweigh it's temporal downsides. Besides, we can always conquer them later."
BRT_reveal_our_horses:0 "Reveal Our Horses!"

BRT_african_blitz:0 "African Blitzkrieg"
   BRT_african_blitz_desc:0 "With a two-pronged attack coming from South Africa and Nigeria the enemy defences in Africa are crumbling. We will rush the continent and expunge the corrupting presence of Europia from this lands."
BRT_send_cornelia:0 "Send Cornelia To The Battlefield"
   BRT_send_cornelia_desc:0 "Our troops are making great progress, but we could go even faster. We will send Second Princess Cornelia to command our troops in the continent. Our enemies will know why she is called our 'Goddess of Victory'."
BRT_disturb_eu_supplies:0 "Disturb EU Supplies"
   BRT_disturb_eu_supplies_desc:0 "The supplies Europia is sending are slowing down our advance in the continent. Our standard tactics are not working, so we will focus our efforts in crushing their logistical capabilities to the ground."
BRT_rush_colonies:0 "Rush To The Borders"
   BRT_rush_colonies_desc:0 "With Cornelia in command and their logistics crushed, Europia no longer stands a chance in Africa. We must rush to the borders of the continent so as to pressure their mainland from the South."
