### Editor's Notes ###
# Britannia does not capitalize other nations' titles (e.g. empress of China) because they are pretentious. This rule does not apply when the title is used in conjunction with a person's name (e.g. Prime Minister Kururugi).
# Adversely, Britannia capitalizes all of its own titles of noble rank and above.
# Whenever the word "empire" is referring to the Holy Britannian Empire, capitalize it.
# Whenever a British spelling of a word could exist, make it exist (except in the editor's notes).
# Please do not use the phrases "in particular" and "in addition"...or else.

news.1.t:0 "International Group NAR Condemns Britannia!"
   news.1.d:0 "Recently, the international human rights group known as NAR issued a statement condemning the policies that the Holy Britannian Empire have imposed on the Numbers, the subjugated native peoples living in Britannia's colonial areas. Specifically, the statement denounces the oppressive conditions reserved for the Numbers and urges a review of current imperial policy. The group became famous after a series of attacks on the Chinese Federation and its Eunuchs and from its support in several cases of corruption in the Euro-Universe. Given its reputation, it had been under surveillance by several intelligence services, but the Britannian Foreign Minister has just declared that the infamous NAR will be put under the category of terrorist organisation.\n\nSurprisingly, Britannia has received a huge wave of criticism from around the world, but no concrete actions are expected from the other superpowers."
news.1.b:0 "Nonsense."
news.1.a:0 "They got what they deserved."

news.2.t:0 "Airstrike on Manila!"
   news.2.d:0 "A month ago, several airstrikes took place in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The bombings appear to have been carried out by the Holy Britannian Empire. Several international newspapers highlighted the devastation caused by the attack. This was also confirmed by journalists present in the country.\n\n According to a Japanese military officer, no efforts were made to reduce the collateral damage inflicted to the native population—an observation made based upon the scarring of the landscape. The country has close ties with the Chinese Federation, and a strong response from the superpower is expected. Despite this, it seems unlikely that a full-blown war will break out anytime soon."
news.2.b:0 "Only collateral damage."
news.2.a:0 "So much violence..."

news.3.t:0 "The Oriental Incident"
   news.3.d:0 "After the Britannian conquest of the Philippines, Japan—known for its rigid neutrality—decided to align its policy with the EU and the Chinese Federation. The two superpowers and their allies had applied enormous economic pressure on Britannia by blockading all of their ports and imposing various economic sanctions in an attempt to force negotiations over the situation in the Pacific.\n\nBritannia, to the surprise of many observers, responded with a quick, clumsy declaration and promise of retaliation. Many consider this a major international defeat for the mighty Britannian Empire, but Euro-Universe's cooperation with China is unlikely to continue after this..."
news.3.b:0 "They will pay..."
news.3.a:0 "Destroy their economy for good!"   

news.5.t:0 "The Fuji Truce"
   news.5.d:0 "To the surprise of the entire world, Japan has somehow managed to hold off the Holy Britannian Empire for much longer than anyone had ever anticipated, although severe casualties are being reported from both nations. After months of brutal fighting, major parts of the Britannian political and military elite have pressured the government and nobility to sign a peace deal in order to avoid further losses.\n\nThe truce will contain favourable terms for Britannia as it will guarantee a large concession regarding Sakuradite extraction and the lending of numerous ports and strategic islands.\n\nUltimately, the war has resulted in deep destabilisation for both countries, and international experts are worried that the repercussions might affect the rest of the world."
news.5.a:0 "This is humiliating...!"
news.5.b:0 "The Britannian Lion has been defeated."

news.6.t:0 "The Division of Japan"
   news.6.d:0 "Few could have expected that the outcome of the Second Pacific War would be a second partition among the three superpowers. Japan has now been split into two rump states.\n\nAfter Britannia had made the risky decision to continue the war despite several losses and a general stalemate, the EU and China sent out an invasion force to avoid a complete Britannian takeover of Japan. The Chinese Army has established a de-facto military protectorate over southern Japan under the guise of humanitarian intervention, while Britannia has created a similar administration in the northern regions.\n\nTensions are high in the devastated country; a lot of Japanese officials, generals, and citizens have already begun flooding into southern Japan. This could create further chaos in the cities."
news.6.a:0 "The setting of their sun."

BRT.1.t:0 "Empress Marianne Is Dead!"
   BRT.1.d:0 "This is a disaster!\n\nOne of the Empire's most important Empresses, Lady Marianne, has been assassinated in the Imperial Palace of Pendragon, and all of her personal guards are dead. The attack was carried out in broad daylight, and the perpetrators are not yet known to the public, though many consider it a terrorist attack.\n\nMarianne was in the building with her two children, Lelouch and Nunnally vi Britannia, who witnessed the entire scene unfold. As a result of this traumatic experience, it seems Princess Nunnally has lost her sight as well as the use of both legs due to gunshot wounds. An investigation to uncover the perpetrators has already begun under the authority of Cornelia li Britannia, former head of the royal guard. The situation is very tense within the government, but the Emperor has decided to cover up the news initially."
BRT.1.a:0 "This could have been avoided..."

BRT.2.t:0 "Something Is Up"
   BRT.2.d:0 "After weeks of thorough investigations, we discovered some connections between the murder and parts of the government itself. The hidden web also seems to connect to the secret Geass Order, a fanatical religious organisation that has influence within the royal family. At this point, it is likely that the Order and some corrupt guards within the palace are behind the assassination. Even if it is an internal plot, this information could cause nationwide panic in the hands of the press. It must be kept secret at all costs."
BRT.2.a:0 "This is getting out of hand..."

BRT.3.t:0 "Dead End"
   BRT.3.d:0 "As we dug deeper into the Geass Order, we found some suspects within the organisation itself. After our discovery, we felt as if we were being watched. Our suspicions were soon confirmed.\n\nOne day while we were working in our office, Imperial Intelligence raided the facility. They were not alone; the police had already surrounded the entire place, and agents were ready to arrest us. We were dismissed from the case soon after; it was deemed unsolved and was quickly archived.\n\nIt seems that Emperor Charles, advised by senior Geass members, ordered the complete closure of the case and the destruction of any evidence. At this point, it is clear that the Emperor knows much more than we thought, but it is useless to continue or even protest given the circumstances."
BRT.3.a:0 "Watch your back, dear detective..."

BRT.4.t:0 "Priorities"
   BRT.4.d:0 "Despite the fact that this hazardous investigation has been forcefully terminated, the consequences and aftermath of Marianne's death are still present. The other two superpowers have noticed our weaker position and have taken a more aggressive attitude towards us. Additionally, many fears have arisen within the royal government and the royal family itself. We must decide where our limited resources should go first."
BRT.4.a:0 "Prioritise the internal situation."
BRT.4.b:0 "Deal with the foreign threat."

BRT.5.t:0 "Operation Rolling Thunder"
   BRT.5.d:0 "After weeks of preparation, we are ready to launch an invasion of the Chinese-controlled Philippines. It is important to capture the entire archipelago quickly so that we can outmanoeuvre the enemy and avoid a direct confrontation.\n\nThree main attacks will launch from Area 10. The main armies will be on Palau, Guam, and Iwo Jima and will have full naval and aerial support. These territories will be critical for our expansion into the Pacific theatre in the near future."
BRT.5.a:0 "Start the operation."

BRT.6.t:0 "Escalation"
   BRT.6.d:0 "The operation is a complete failure.\n\nAlthough we have made several gains, the entire archipelago is not under Britannian control. The war is dragging on for far too long, and the Chinese Federation has sent us an ultimatum: surrender the island to the Eunuchs or face total war. It’s important to highlight that the latter option is very risky, as our military in the Pacific isn’t at full strength, and the Knights of the Round are busy in South America. After taking these facts into consideration, Emperor Charles thinks that the risks are too high."
BRT.6.a:0 "Continue the war!"
BRT.6.b:0 "Back down..."

BRT.7.t:0 "The Chinese Federation Retaliates!"
   BRT.7.d:0 "After our attack on the Philippines, it appears that the Chinese Federation formed a temporary alliance with the other superpower, the Euro-Universe, and pressured Japan to align with its interests. As a result of this surprising move, Britannia is now isolated from most of the world's trade due to numerous economic sanctions and embargoes. While this will greatly damage the Britannian economy in the short term, it could be an opportunity to achieve imperial autarky and prove the greatness of the Homeland once and for all!"
BRT.7.b:0 "This was unexpected. Reorganise the budget with further austerity!"

BRT.8.t:0 "The Honolulu Proposal"
   BRT.8.d:0 "To our surprise, the Prime Minister reached an interesting compromise with the European Union. He met with some Russian delegates at Hawaii Naval Command to discuss the recent incident and improve the bitter relations between the two superpowers. The Paris government is ready to secretly loosen part of the trade blockade and allow limited trade relations. In return, we will give Attu Island, a place where the EU had laid a claim several years ago, to the Russian Republic. Considering its position in the extreme north, it won't be an important strategic loss."
BRT.8.a:0 "Accept the resolution."
BRT.8.b:0 "Refuse the resolution."

BRT.9.t:0 "The Departure of Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally"
   BRT.9.d:0 "The Emperor has decided on a permanent arrangement for Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally; the children of the deceased Empress Marianne will be sent to Japan for an indefinite period of time. This move will prove to be a useful way to turn Lelouch and Nunnally into political pawns and, at the same time, reassure the royal family of their safety. While visiting the island nation, they will be put under the protection of Prime Minister Kururugi and his son. We will tell the press that their trip is for educational purposes only."
BRT.9.a:0 "It is necessary."

BRT.10.t:0 "Total Victory Over Japan!"
   BRT.10.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves was a great success!\n\nIn but a few months, we have managed to crush any Japanese resistance with our new advanced weapons, the Knightmares. After ruthless fighting in the streets, the Japanese government finally surrendered. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kururugi has mysteriously disappeared, leaving the country in a state of chaos and anarchy. Furthermore, many officials fled to our enemy, China, and numerous enemy generals and officers went into hiding.\n\nRegardless, large deposits of Sakuradite are now in our hands, and we have shown our true strength to the world. By officially forming Area 11, the authority of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and the imperial family will be firmly consolidated. The future looks bright.\n\nAll Hail Britannia!"
BRT.10.a:0 "Establish the new Area."
BRT.10.b:0 "Establish the new Area.\n(Play as Area 11)"

BRT.11.t:0 "A Protracted Stalemate"
   BRT.11.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves is a partial failure, since our main army has been unsuccessful in forcing Japan into an unconditional surrender. The war has persisted for over half a year, and many generals are beginning to worry that this swamp will take away resources needed for other vital theatres.\n\nAlthough Emperor Charles wants to continue the war, Prime Minister Odysseus and a few other ministers have proposed an alternative peace deal which will grant us access to all Sakuradite mines among other minor concessions. We must make our decision carefully, as the peace deal could be seen as an indication of weakness by the other great powers."
BRT.11.a:0 "We won't give up!"
BRT.11.b:0 "Demand a truce."

BRT.13.t:0 "Movements in the Shadows"
   BRT.13.d:0 "V.V. was the first ally of Charles during the Emblem of Blood. This granted him a powerful position in the current administration, allowing him to retain a considerable amount of freedom to do as he wished.\n\nIn more recent years, V.V. has been the main impediment to Marianne's influence, countering her power considerably. He remains, however, her least vocal opponent, instead preferring to take an underhanded approach to avoid unnecessary attention. The Secret Services are always keeping an eye on him though, and only an order from the Emperor could prevent them from doing so."
BRT.13.a:0 "Something's up."

BRT.14.t:0 "Memories of the Emblem of Blood"
   BRT.14.d:0 "Many years ago, a violent internal feud occurred within the Britannian imperial family. During this period, assassinations and betrayals became frequent amongst the various claimants to the throne. Accordingly, this era of the Empire's history saw domestic instability peak within the nation.\n\nThe situation was partially resolved when several noble families, all of whom supported the succession of a strong leader who could put an end to the bloodshed, intervened in the chaos at the cost of reducing some of the nobility's power.\n\nThe leader they chose was Charles zi Britannia."
BRT.14.a:0 "An era to forget..."

BRT.15.t:0 "The Office of the Prime Minister"
   BRT.15.d:0 "Ever since our people were driven out of Europia and had the Britannia line assume the throne, it has been tradition for the First Prince, the heir to the Empire, to occupy the position of Prime Minister. However, it seems that First Prince Odysseus has been rather indecisive, allowing the nobility more leeway than is strictly appropriate. This irresponsible state of affairs has persisted for far too long. Today, the Emperor made a declaration that Odysseus shall step down from his position in favour of one of his more competent siblings."
BRT.15.a:0 "Farewell, First Prince."
    
BRT.16.t:0 "The Struggle for Prime Minister"
   BRT.16.d:0 "With the First Prince's ejection from the Office of the Prime Minister, the position second only to the Emperor sits empty. For many, this is a rare opportunity, but two individuals currently stand out amongst the crowds of the royal court.\n\nSecond Prince Schneizel and First Princess Guinevere possess significant spheres of influence and are in the best position to run the esteemed office. Doing so will certainly boost their chances to inherit the Empire as Odysseus' prospects have now severely weakened."
BRT.16.a:0 "The name of the game is "power"."

BRT.17.t:0 "East or West?"
   BRT.17.d:0 "The Emperor has expressed a desire to expand the holdings of the Empire. The future Prime Minister must choose a section of the world to conquer as the Empire cannot comfortably maintain two fronts at the present time. The location they choose does not matter so long as the incoming Prime Minister heeds the will of Emperor Charles zi Britannia!"
BRT.17.a:0 "East or west, our homeland is the best!"

BRT.18.t:0 "Flavours of Autarky"
   BRT.18.d:0 "As with most issues, Second Prince Schneizel and First Princess Guinevere have taken completely different stances regarding our economic system. Guinevere has been swayed by major corporate interests, whereas Schneizel has long promoted a system driven by technological advancement. Should we favour a specific candidate or take a balanced path?"

   BRT.19.d:0 "In order to maintain the cohesion of the Holy Britannian Empire, it has become necessary to root out parts of the system which may be working to our detriment. Our two candidates have been battling in the Imperial Court for days to no avail. They must reach a resolution soon."
BRT.19.a:0 "We must come to a resolution."

BRT.20.t:0 "A Clandestine Rendezvous"

BRT.20.a:0 "Détente?"

BRT.21.t:0 "A Future Proposal"
   BRT.21.d:0 "Second Prince Schneizel has floated the idea of marrying the young empress of China to our First Prince—a devious move to be certain, as this will pave the way to completely ousting Odysseus."

### Ideas/Traits ###
The_Great_Homecoming_Phase_1:0 "The Great Homecoming"
darwinist:0 "Social Darwinism Proponent"
   POLITICS_CHARLES_BRTT_DESC:0 "From the very beginning of Charles' reign, the government has idealised the doctrine of Social Darwinism. As such, the propaganda sector uses three main slogans: Competition is equality, Domination is peace, and Strength is justice. While these words inspire the soldiers of the Empire and strengthen the power of the government, they also increase the popularity of the extremist faction, the Purists. Additionally, they create a state of perpetual social tension between the various nationalities and social classes."
efficient_administration:0 "Efficient Administration"
   efficient_administration_desc:0 "The Britannian colonial administration is known to be one of the most efficient in the world with its centralised bureaucracy and tight military control. These facets ensure law and order are being upheld in all territories whilst said territories are under development, ultimately allowing Britannian colonists to move and live there peacefully."
legal_segregation:0 "Institutionalised Segregation"
   legal_segregation_desc:0 "Abiding by the tenets of Social Darwinism, Britannia implemented a complex and brutal system of segregation and oppression to use against minorities. In Britannia's conquered territories, the original inhabitants are designated as the "Numbers", and their cultures are forcibly destroyed by aggressive policies of assimilation or, in the worst cases, ethnic cleansing. In general, they enjoy a much lower standard of living and are excluded from most opportunities to advance in society."
militarized_academia:0 "Militarised Academia"
   militarized_academia_desc:0 "The royal government is currently diverting a large number of resources and funds to implement Odysseus' proposal. This consists of the further expansion and modernisation of the armed forces, including innovative weapons and armaments."
extreme_stratocracy:0 "Strict Stratocracy"
   extreme_stratocracy_desc:0 "Britannian society is well known throughout the world for the rigid stratification of its citizens. They are divided by their lineages with little opportunity for change once placed into one of the various social classes within the civilian or military sectors."
aristocratic_families:0 "Tyranny of the Aristocracy"
   aristocratic_families_desc:0 "Many British aristocrats followed the monarchy into exile upon Napoleon's conquest of the home islands. After the creation and stabilisation of various imperial institutions, these nobles formalised their influence in the Senate, as it gave them the veto, their only means of limiting the Emperor's power."
army_primacy:0 "Army Primacy"
   army_primacy_desc:0 "Britannia's deep-seated militarism influences its entire society and is often encouraged by Darwinist propaganda and the Imperial Press. The average military officer's career is usually privileged with an increased salary and a real possibility of entering the nobility, effectively increasing the officer's morale and, as a result, their overall productivity and efficiency."
financial_conglomerates:0 "Financial Conglomerates"
   financial_conglomerates_desc:0 "The Britannian economy is characterised by a series of powerful economic and financial conglomerates often controlled by noble families or retired generals. This fosters poor working conditions and an incredibly weak middle class."

court_intrigues:0 "The Nobility's Subterfuge"
   court_intrigues_desc:0 "Decades have passed since the Emblem of Blood era ended, but infighting and hidden unrest have begun to emerge inside the Royal Palace once again, mainly due to the great influence that Empress Marianne has on the current government. Although Charles' iron fist had put an end to the violent episodes of years past, it seems that won't be enough this time."
VV_situation:0 "The V.V. Situation"
   VV_situation_desc:0 "V.V., the highest priest and head of the Geass Order, is making strange moves behind the government's back. However, it's important to highlight that the Emperor is in close contact with him, so there shouldn't be too many problems with preventing any potentially dangerous accidents or situations from happening."
BRT_assassination:0 "An Unexpected Death"
   BRT_assassination_desc:0 "V.V. has finally made his move. This will have incalculable consequences..."
BRT_evidence:0 "Close the Capital!"
   BRT_evidence_desc:0 "First, we need to shut down all access points leading into and out of the capital. That way, we can save face whilst stopping any witnesses from leaving Pendragon."
BRT_investigating:0 "Continue the Investigation!"
   BRT_investigating_desc:0 "A special team of detectives has been formed to solve the case, but we must keep an eye on them..."
BRT_case_unsolved:0 "Unsolved Case?"
   BRT_case_unsolved_desc:0 "The detectives have crossed a line they shouldn't have. They've uncovered too many of the imperial government's secrets. We must stop this investigation AT ONCE!"
BRT_continue_plan:0 "Contact the Prime Minister"
   BRT_continue_plan_desc:0 "As a result of the accident concerning the late Empress, we must stabilise the situation in the capital. Prime Minister Odysseus can help us with that."

# Left Path #
BRT_foreign_situation:0 "Confront the Chinese Federation"
   BRT_foreign_situation_desc:0 "In order to regain our power on the world stage, we could fight our rival, the Chinese Federation, in the Pacific. Despite their numbers, the Chinese army isn’t ready for a surprise attack on their dominions in Asia."
BRT_bombings:0 "Airstrike Manila"
   BRT_bombings_desc:0 "The Philippines is one of the most exposed puppets of the Chinese Federation and, because of its location near Area 10 and the Britannian Pacific Fleet, also a perfect target. In order to cripple their infrastructure and morale, we are going to launch a major airstrike on their capital, Manila, regardless of the number of civilians present. The Chinese Federation will surely have a slow response to this."
BRT_troops:0 "Border Conflicts With Japan"
   BRT_troops_desc:0 "We can initiate some border conflicts with Japan on the island of Ishigaki so they will not interfere in our affairs. Several Britannian patrolcraft are poised to fire warning shots at any Japanese fishing vessel near the coast to distract their navy whilst we conduct our operation in the Philippines."
BRT_army:0 "Take the Philippines"
   BRT_army_desc:0 "The Philippines is one of the few territories that stand between us and the Chinese Federation. It must be brought under our control as soon as possible in preparation for our campaigns in Asia."
BRT_oriental:0 "The Oriental Incident"
   BRT_oriental_desc:0 "After our operation in the Philippines, we received condemnations from every nation in Asia, and the most important ones have decided to embargo our goods and impose harsh sanctions on our trade. This is a disaster for our economy. We must act quickly, or the consequences will be most severe."
BRT_protectionism:0 "Enact Protectionist Policies"
   BRT_protectionism_desc:0 "In order to defend the Britannian industry from a crash induced by the embargoes placed upon us, we must redirect our efforts towards our domestic economic situation. A package of protectionist measures will preserve the competitiveness of many companies, although it will be costly politically."
BRT_diplomacy:0 "Propose Negotiations"
   BRT_diplomacy_desc:0 "If we hope to restore the losses we've sustained from the embargoes, we must open diplomatic negotiations with the Europeans. We can organise a trade deal in secret, offering the Attu Islands in exchange for Europia beginning to import our goods, all whilst the Chinese Federation remains none the wiser. The northern islands are going to become part of Russia, but their strategic value for Operation Tidal Wave is insignificant."
BRT_aid_MON_rebels:0 "Aid Mongolian Rebels"
   BRT_aid_MON_rebels_desc:0 "Many ministers have proposed a strong reaction to the embargoes: the funding of several separatist groups in Mongolia. They will be reached using our connections from within the Kyoto House, the Japanese yakuza, and several Chinese triads." # This makes no sense as a response to embargoes. It would make much more sense if placed before the Philippines invasion to serve as a distraction for the Chinese Federation to help further create the illusion of their slow response.
BRT_block_sup:0 "Flex Our Military Might"
   BRT_block_sup_desc:0 "In this key moment, it is crucial to remind the other superpowers exactly what we are capable of if they take their aggressive stances too far. The Knights of the Round are perfect for this role. They will be deployed in strategic zones in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans."

# Middle Path #
BRT_domestic_front:0 "Manage the Domestic Front"
   BRT_domestic_front_desc:0 "In order to further stabilise the nation, the Prime Minister has suggested a number of measures to counter internal troublemakers and hidden threats."
BRT_reassure_family:0 "Reassure the Royal Family"
   BRT_reassure_family_desc:0 "Lelouch and Nunnally, the children of Marianne vi Britannia, are in an extremely dangerous position in Pendragon and, after Lelouch’s ridiculous request, shall be sent to Japan as bargaining tools. As members of the royal family, they will be under Prime Minister Kururugi’s protection."
BRT_control_purists:0 "Sideline the Purist Faction"
   BRT_control_purists_desc:0 "The Purists have just acquired a dangerous amount of popularity amongst the imperial soldiers thanks to the Marianne affair. They currently pose a danger to the crown. They must be sidelined from Britannian politics, for now."
BRT_nobility_ties:0 "Reaffirm the Nobility's Dominance"
   BRT_nobility_ties_desc:0 "It’s important to reaffirm the dominance of the nobility within the Britannian political system and support the mighty families of Pendragon who helped us numerous times during the Emblem of Blood era. This will weaken the radical factions whilst boosting the oligarchic financial conglomerates."
BRT_laziness_odysseus:0 "Sway the Prime Minister"
   BRT_laziness_odysseus_desc:0 "Despite his initial commitment in response to Marianne's death, Prime Minister Odysseus has been becoming lazier by the day. We need to have a little "talk" with him to ensure his active participation in state politics."

# Right Path #
BRT_KN_dev:0 "Continue Knightmare Development"
   BRT_KN_dev_desc:0 "Even before Marianne's death, our scientists were experimenting with Sakuradite to create powerful weapons called "Knightmares" that will present us with an enormous advantage over our enemies. The research is complex, though, and will still require some time to complete."
BRT_KN_module_1:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 1"
   BRT_KN_module_1_desc:0 "We have created an emergency cockpit to serve as the base of our Knightmares. It is equipped with a rocket engine so that the pilot may fly to safety should their Knightmare be destroyed. There isn't much room to move around inside as a result of the added safety equipment, but the benefits of this design heavily outweigh the drawbacks. After all, every soldier saved will live to fight for us another day."
BRT_KN_module_2:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 2"
   BRT_KN_module_2_desc:0 "We have installed a set of wheels into the legs of every Knightmare. We call this the "Landspinner Propulsion System". It will afford our Knightmares significant boosts to both mobility and speed whilst travelling by ground."
BRT_KN_module_3:0 "Knightmare Research:\nPhase 3"
   BRT_KN_module_3_desc:0 "We have developed a sophisticated camera which we named the Factsphere Sensor. Its purpose is to transmit thermographic data directly to the pilot. It utilises a wide variety of hardware to provide the pilot with an extensive web of information about their enemies, their allies, and their surroundings."
BRT_KN_ashford:0 "Help From the Ashford Family"
   BRT_KN_ashford_desc:0 "The Ashford family have always been loyal allies to our government. Currently, they are managing a fairly efficient research institute which we could use to properly develop Knightmares. With their assistance, we will finally be able to create a proper Knightmare module to standardise into our army."
BRT_KN_old_guard:0 "Fight the Old Guard"
   BRT_KN_old_guard_desc:0 "Several old generals, including our current Chief of Army, are still opposing the creation of Knightmares. They rely on traditional tactics, considering Knightmares to be out of the realm of fantasy and, consequently, a waste of resources. If they refuse to see past their preconceived notions, we have no further need for them. Therefore, by direct order of Emperor Charles zi Britannia, they must be sidelined."
BRT_KN_glasgow:0 "Glasgow's Deployment"
   BRT_KN_glasgow_desc:0 "At last, we have managed to combine all of our newest technologies, creating a reliable Knightmare unit! After we integrate them into several of our army divisions, we will finally be ready to confront Japan and its protectors. This technological feat signifies a glorious day for our mighty Empire. All Hail Britannia!"

BRT_odysseus_resign:0 "...And Now an Empty Position"
   BRT_odysseus_resign_desc:0 "Crown Prince Odysseus eu Britannia has proven himself nothing short of a complete embarrassment to the Britannian Imperial Family. Luckily, stripping him of many of his responsibilities is an easy matter, and by sidelining him, the ferocious contenders encircling his imaginative throne can squabble bitterly over the scraps. "

BRT_reinforce_new_areas:0 "Defend Our New Areas"
   BRT_reinforce_new_areas_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that our Britannian ground forces are incapable of defending every square inch of our glorious Empire.

BRT_paris_conference:0 "Paris' Secret Meeting" # Why is it secret, and why is Paris Hilton involved?
   BRT_paris_conference_desc:0 "The United Republic of Europia should be "reassured" about our intentions, placated whenever possible, and duped into thinking they are safe from our reach. Some accommodations might have to be made for the sake of our other interests, but these matter little. Once we have what we need, Europia will be swept aside with one swift stroke of a pen."

We will bring the greatest gift of life to their morally bankrupt masses: the sweet release of death. When we do, we shall retake the land that is rightfully ours! But why stop there? Let us seize their land as well, just as they once did to us!"
BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet:0 "Fund the Atlantic Fleet"
   BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet_desc:0 "Our Atlantic defence fleet sits rusting away in our docks. We have neglected a crucial aspect of our global force projection, permitting our sailors to become lethargic. By appointing determined young naval officers to standings of tremendous responsibility, we will rejuvenate and adequately outfit this force for the next significant battle on the ocean's surface."
BRT_china_detente:0 "Détente With China"
   BRT_china_detente_desc:0 "Even if it pains us to our very core, we must reach a mutual understanding with the Chinese Federation. Highly publicised engagements between our ambassadors will do much to mend the gap between our two nation-states. If we utilise soothing, complicated words, we will surely scramble their biologically inferior minds to the point where they will agree with our terms for every subject."

BRT_WALTZ_DESC:0 "The origins of Britannia can be traced back to the Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in a stunning victory for Napoleon. During the Napoleonic invasion of mainland Britain, many aristocrats and nobles escaped alongside the royal family to their dominions in North America.\nAfter the first few hard years, the new nation, inspired by the principles of Social Darwinism, consolidated into an absolute monarchy and gradually extended its rule across both continents. Eventually, the Britannian Empire became a global superpower after it made significant advancements in science and military technologies."

BRT_influence_EU_colonies:0 "Influence EU Colonies"

   BRT_finalise_spartition_plans_desc:0 "The Chinese Federation is willing to enter war on our side, but is asking for territorial partition once Europia collapses.
