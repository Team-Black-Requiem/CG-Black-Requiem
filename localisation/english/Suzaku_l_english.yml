suzaku.1.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 1"
suzaku.1.d:0 "Some days had passed since the secret transfer of Kururugi and his son Suzaku into the new isolated home, but something wasn't right inside Suzaku. He witnessed the horrors of the war in first person, but he believed he could rely, at least, on his father. This changed after Suzaku read some papers, forgotten by Kururugi on the floor, that made him shout without thinking-\n\n"What's the meaning of this, dad!?"\n\n"What to you mean, Suzaku?"\n\n"Do you really plan to continue Operation Archer until the very end?!"\n\n"Well...it's the only hope to save Japan after all..."\n\n"Are you kidding me? The Britannians are killing thousands of Japanese people every day! Why don't you just surrender to the enemy!"\n\n"And throw away our identity? Our nation!? We'll be lapdogs!\n\n"But think about the lives that would be spared, don't you care about them?!"\n\n"Precisely because I CARE about them, I want to uphold this struggle to the last man!"\n\n"Enough excuses! Are you seriously about to act on this madness?!""
suzaku.1.a:0 ""I can only promise you that Operation Archer could be post-poned.""
suzaku.1.b:0 ""This is necessary, Suzaku! We can't lose our determination to fight now!""
suzaku.2.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 2"
suzaku.2.d:0 "After a brief silence, Kururugi noticed his son was calmer, but that didn't deter the boy from confronting his father not long after again, seeking to continue with the argument.\n\n"Is this really necessary?"\n\n"Japan stands alone, we are the only ones who can do this."\n\n"Then ask for help from other nations! I know they are scared of Britannia, but we could offer them some Sakuradite!"\n\n"Don't make me laugh. Sakuradite is the main reason we were dragged to this situation."\n\n"That's true, but..."\n\n"Our so-called friendly nations won't move an inch for us out of "good will". We can't give out our treasures for foreign exploitment."\n\n"Doesn't it seem a more manageable price instead of human lives?"\n\n"Listen to me, Suzaku. Now, the price of a human life is less than a mine of Sakuradite."\n\n"What are you saying..."\n\n"You heard me! You are too young for politics!"\n\n"You are joking, right?!""
suzaku.2.a:0 ""I've never been so damn serious in my fucking life!""
suzaku.2.b:0 ""Sorry, Suzaku. I spoke without thinking...""
suzaku.3.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 3"
suzaku.3.d:0 "Suzaku was shaking. His heartbeats were racing, and he just happened to spot a knife laying on a small drawer. The situation was tense, and Suzaku was conflicted: Who was Japan's true enemy? Britannia is doubtlessly responsible. But is the man that wishes to drag the bloodbath onwards any less of a criminal?\n\n"Then, what about the future of Nunnally and Lelouch?"\n\n"Can we change topic for now?"\n\n"Hell no! Tell me what role they're for in this war!"\n\n"Don't worry, I have already prepared a plan for them."\n\n"You are lying, aren't you!"\n\n"Listen Suzaku, they are Britannians, they are the ENEMY. Have you forgotten that already?"\n\n"That doesn't mean anything to me anymore!"\n\n"You have changed since the last time we met them, haven't you?"\n\n"I told you to not change subject. Now, what is your plan?""
suzaku.3.a:0 ""They will be sent to China, a safer place than this endless warzone.""
suzaku.3.b:0 ""...I will offer their lives to Britannia, to save our country.""
