### Focus Tree ###

remember_sonya:0 "Remember Sonya" 
	remember_sonya_desc:0 "Our people have been deeply wounded by the passing of our dear Sonya. She may be gone, but her bears shall carry on her legacy. We shall fight for the freedom of all bears in due time. But today, we mourn. Let us have a day of peace before we march onward to our new world."
the_new_face_of_russia:0 "The New Face of Russia" 
	the_new_face_of_russia_desc:0 "The time has come for the socialist movement to receive a fresh, new face they can all look to in times of desperation. What could be more socialist than a bear?"
bear_market:0 "Bear Market"
	bear_market_desc:0 "We have taken up the mantle of the Bear Revolution, but we cannot bring about a revolution on bearpower alone. We will need to capture some hooman specialists and learn their methods of resource extraction if we are to spread our revolution far and wide and liberate all bears from the hoomans."
bear_economy:0 "Bear Economics"
	bear_economy_desc:0 "Our republic must have a currency of its own. Therefore, by request of the people, the first industry we shall focus on building up is the fish industry. The workers will begin trading the eyes of fish for other goods. The republic is a nation of choice, and the people have chosen what holds value. Our currency will be known as the RFE, or the Republican fish eyes."
train_the_bears_for_war:0 "Train the Bears for War"
	train_the_bears_for_war_desc:0 "In order to ensure the survival of the bear race, we must militarize our people in preparation for war with the hoomans. The Day of Espan’s Dawn shall soon be upon us."
bear_necessities:0 "Bear Necessities"
	bear_necessities_desc:0 "With the birth of the republic, we have taken responsibility for the care of its people. Sonya had taught me many things, but one of the first was how people will fight for the land and home they love. The republic shall become that home. We shall meet our people’s needs and ensure that they receive proper shelter, sustenance, and safety until we are free to live as we wish in this world."
beary_good:0 "Beary Good!"
	beary_good_desc:0 "Though our people are new to the concept of a workforce, they’re amazingly built for it. One bear is able to do the work of five men. As a result, our industries have easily outshone those of the hoomans. The hoomans were killing the planet to meet their needs; we only need to work hard to meet ours."
call_out_to_the_international_bears:0 "Call Out to the International Bears" 
	call_out_to_the_international_bears_desc:0 "We have called out to our brothers and sisters around the world. They have arrived sooner than expected, their teeth and claws coated in blood as their rebirth was no different than ours. We can now train them, arm them, and teach them the hooman ways of war."
bear_revolution:0 "Bear Revolution"
	bear_revolution_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that we cannot remain as just one nation. This land has limits in what it can sustain both agriculturally and population-wise. We must spread our republic across the borders of the world to restore the land back to how it once was when Espan first crafted it."
establish_the_polar_fleet:0 "Establish the Polar Fleet" 
	establish_the_polar_fleet_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters to the north have demonstrated that ice patches are good for short-term naval travel. In order for us to expand the Polar Fleet, we must confiscate all vessels within the country, starting with those in the city of Vladivostok."
beary_good_navy:0 "Beary Good Navy" 
	beary_good_navy_desc:0 "The Polar Fleet requires an upgrade. To achieve this, we have tasked our grizzly population with becoming the nation’s R&D department. Their sole objective is to bring us up to par with the hoomans, starting with our navy’s capabilities."  	
establish_knightbears:0 "Establish the Knightbears"
	establish_knightbears_desc:0 "The Knightmare divisions that Britannia have deployed are almost perfect, but they contain a vital flaw: we cannot fit inside the cockpits. Thus, we have called upon our tiny friends from the Pacific, the koalas, to pilot them for us as our elite Knightbear force."
getting_our_bearings:0 "Getting Our Bearings"
	getting_our_bearings_desc:0 "The hoomans have demonstrated the importance of a proper air force. As such, we believe that our sun bear brethren are fit for the job. We shall establish our bearings in the sky and protect our people from hooman bombardment."
bear_force_one:0 "Bear Force 1"
	bear_force_one_desc:0 "To our delightful surprise, the hoomans cannot withstand our mighty sun bears’ piloting skills. Despite our might in the air, our bearplanes are too out-of-date for our pilots to fully utilize their talents. To remedy this, the grizzly researchers have come up with specially designed cockpits to give our pilots more room to move around inside, immediately fixing most of their skill issues."
release_the_war_bears:0 "Release the War Bears" 
	release_the_war_bears_desc:0 "Our preparations for Operation Bearium, the operation to crush hoomanity, have been completed. The hoomans shall bear witness to our strength on this day as we overwhelm their fortifications and break their armies. The revolution shall not be stopped until the Earth becomes bearable once again."
sonya_will_be_avenged:0 "Sonya Will Be Avenged"
	sonya_will_be_avenged_desc:0 "My beloved carebear, Sonya, had always taken care of her people. She taught me the value in the smallest of cubs. I know this, yet the image of that snake taking her life keeps flashing before my eyes. For that, we cannot let the hoomans go unpunished."
bears_are_unpawable:0 "The Unbearable Reality"
	bears_are_unpawable_desc:0 "The hoomans believe that our conquest can be stopped. Their barbearic minds cannot comprehend the fact that their time as Earth’s dominant species is over. They have lost their not-so-rightful claim to the world."
beartial_law:0 "Martial Claw"
	beartial_law_desc:0 "With the expansion of the republic continuing on all fronts, it’s time that we declare martial claw across the land. The hoomans will learn their place as Espan had once roared about in our history."
force_the_humans_to_fight:0 "Establish Hooman Battalions"
	force_the_humans_to_fight_desc:0 "With a vast amount of the hoomans now belonging to our republic, the bear minimum that we require of them is for them to fight on our behalf. Why should we continue to waste waves of our own people when we have a massive reserve of hoomans to replace our losses?"
expand_the_knightbears:0 "Expand the Knightbears" 
	expand_the_knightbears_desc:0 "With the hoomans expanding their Knightmares’ capabilities, the grizzly department has decided to focus their efforts on going beyond what the hoomans have managed. "
beartality:0 "Espan's Dawn"
	beartality_desc:0 "The hoomans have cruelly molded the world into their image. It will take nothing less than the same level of beartality they had shown us in the past to help them see the new world we have molded for ourselves. Espan has blessed us with the power to break the last of the hoomans’ resistance with our Knightbear battalions.\nThis will be our day: the Day of Espan’s Dawn."

###Industry
BWR_Industrial_Development:0 "Industrial Development"
	BWR_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "Our nation desperately needs an industrial overhaul. We need to invest in better systems of industrialization to uplift our nation out of the economic disparity we’ve found ourselves in during these uncertain times."
BWR_Civillian_sector:0 "Civilian sector"
	BWR_Civillian_sector_desc:0 "The time has come for us to build new factories from the ground up. With this, our nation can reach the quotas and sustainability necessary to become an economic powerhouse."
BWR_Civillian_sector_2:0 "Civilian sector 2"
	BWR_Civillian_sector_2_desc:0 "As a continuation of our current economic policy, the government shall invest in more state-owned factories in order to boost the economy of the nation and work towards the long-term economic prosperity of our people."
BWR_Civillian_sector_3:0 "Civilian sector 3"
	BWR_Civillian_sector_3_desc:0 "To accomplish the medium-term goals of our economic plan, we shall continue our focus on the construction of factories to meet the demands for our growing consumer industry."
BWR_Civillian_sector_4:0 "Civilian sector 4"
	BWR_Civillian_sector_4_desc:0 "As the final steps of our economic plan come to fruition, the magnum opus for uplifting our country into wealth and prosperity is finally ready to be initiated! In the very near future, the nations of the world shall bow before our sheer economic power!"
BWR_infastructure_sector:0 "Infrastructure sector"
	BWR_infastructure_sector_desc:0 "Our nation’s infrastructure has become dilapidated as past corruption and ignorance had made us neglect its maintenance for some time. We must launch an initiative to fix and expand our infrastructure so that we can restore it to its former glory."
BWR_infastructure_sector_2:0 "Infrastructure sector 2"
	BWR_infastructure_sector_2_desc:0 "The next stage of our infrastructure development may now begin. We shall work towards building a sustainable nationwide transportation system to supply our military and the general populace for many years to come."
BWR_infastructure_sector_3:0 "Infrastructure sector 3"
	BWR_infastructure_sector_3_desc:0 "We must keep up the momentum we’ve gained so far. We shall clear up the old infrastructure to make way for new homes, factories, and facilities that will reinforce the very foundations of our nation."
BWR_infastructure_sector_4:0 "Infrastructure sector 4"
	BWR_infastructure_sector_4_desc:0 "At last, the final phase of our infrastructure development plan shall commence. Our capital city will become self-sustainable for the foreseeable future, and its economy shall truly reflect that of a rising nation’s capital city."
BWR_military_sector:0 "Military sector"
	BWR_military_sector_desc:0 "In order to be able to properly defend ourselves from exterior threats, we need an arms industry capable of supplying our infantry with weapons reliable enough to combat the ever-growing hostile forces that seek to undermine our stability as a nation."
BWR_military_sector_2:0 "Military sector 2"
	BWR_military_sector_2_desc:0 "Another aspect we must consider is the large amounts of armor divisions our enemies may field. Let alone the possibility of facing knightmares. A technology that is quickly showing a new face of war and is developing rapidly into something beyond armor. We must invest in our artillery and anti tank capabilities. If we are to hold our own against such technological might."
BWR_military_sector_3:0 "Military sector 3"
	BWR_military_sector_3_desc:0 "The skies are a theater of combat often overlooked in battle, but even so, we can clearly see that whoever controls the skies controls the flow of battle. Producing aircraft capable of guaranteeing our superiority in the sky is of utmost priority."
BWR_military_sector_4:0 "Military sector 4"
	BWR_military_sector_4_desc:0 "Our final military industrial expansion shall greatly increase our military production and advance our military technology, ensuring our sovereignty and the continued protection of our nation."
BWR_New_Technical_Institute:0 "A New Technical Institute"

BWR_Synthethic:0 "Synthetic Sources"
	BWR_Synthethic_desc:0 "In order to fuel our growing industry, we need the resources to be able to properly sustain ourselves while continuing the expansion of our industry and innovating new technologies capable of aiding with our industrial expansion."
BWR_Civillian_sector_5:0 "Civilian sector 5"
	BWR_Civillian_sector_5_desc:0 "Our second national industrial plan has been set in motion. The factories we shall erect here will provide the means that the state needs in order to secure our economic independence."
BWR_Prosperous_Nation:0 "A Prosperous Nation"
	BWR_Prosperous_Nation_desc:0 "Finally, our nation has reached true prosperity. Our people live off of the wealth provided to them from the recent expansion of our national economic industry. We have achieved what lesser nations could only dream of."
BWR_Pink_Saphires:0 "Pink Sapphires?"
	BWR_Pink_Saphires_desc:0 "Sakuradite is a precious resource which we cannot afford to forgo. Other nations use this resource to greatly advance their capabilities as a nation both economically and militarily. We need this resource, and we need it now!"
BWR_New_Railways:0 "New Railways"
	BWR_New_Railways_desc:0 "To ensure our nation is capable of not only defending itself but also sustaining itself economically, we need to construct a railway network capable of meeting our needs as a growing nation on the cusp of innovation."
BWR_military_sector_5:0 "Military sector 5"
	BWR_military_sector_5_desc:0 "Now that we have the resources capable of enacting our second military expansion, we can truly equip our military with all sorts of equipment. We shall have one of—no, the best equipped military in the world!"
BWR_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
	BWR_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "Our nation’s economic future is edging closer and closer to a militaristically centered one. Our war machine will continue to grow; can we sustain it indefinitely, or will it lead to our downfall?"
BWR_Advanced_Technical_Institute:0 "Advanced Technical Institute"
	BWR_Advanced_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "The recent growth of our industry has given us an increase in our capacity to innovate and improve upon our current technologies. We will gain the edge on other nations who believe themselves superior to us technologically."

# Navy Branch #
BWR_Establish_Admiralty:0 "Expand Admiralty"
	BWR_Establish_Admiralty_desc:0 "It is finally time for our nation to reach out beyond our coastline. Before we can even consider sending ships out, we must establish both the admiralty and the chain of command. We only have a few men and women capable of filling this role within our nation. Let us hope they’re up to the challenge."
BWR_Confiscate_Dockyards:0 "Confiscate Civilian Dockyards"
	BWR_Confiscate_Dockyards_desc:0 "Though trade is vital to us in this uncertain time, we cannot sit idly by as the giants stomp around us, for it will only be a matter of time before we are the ones being stomped. We will confiscate ports, harbors, and any man-made outcroppings that are used for boat repairs. This makeshift collection of dockyards shall provide us with the ability to produce our own vessels of war."
BWR_Naval_School:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
	BWR_Naval_School_desc:0 "Now that we have a high admiral and a few vessels in the beginning stages of construction, we must establish an academy to train seamen into officers so that we can fill out the rest of the ranks in our command structure."
BWR_New_Age:0 "The New Age of Naval Warfare"
	BWR_New_Age_desc:0 "Although ship designs have not been altered much over the years, the tactics and roles for each ship class have changed drastically. We must catch up on our naval doctrines; otherwise, there is a significant chance that we may be caught unawares in our very first battle."
BWR_Coastal_Defense_Fleet:0 "Establish the Coastal Defense Fleet"
	BWR_Coastal_Defense_Fleet_desc:0 "With our production capabilities growing and our command structure firmly established, we can now distribute our first task to the navy. The goal of this task is nothing tougher than patrolling along our coastline to give the crew some experience on the sea. Though this may seem like a minor mission on the surface, it has successfully bolstered our nation's pride and hope."
BWR_Honorable_Battle:0 "The Honorable Tides of Battle"
	BWR_Honorable_Battle_desc:0 "Our nation is too prideful and honorable to hide beneath the waves like a skulking predator. We will stand tall and head towards our enemies with the might and grandeur once held by the fleets of old. We will pummel them with our formidable armaments."
BWR_Heavy_Ship_Design:0 "Heavy Ship Designs"
	BWR_Heavy_Ship_Design_desc:0 "Now that we have a strong screening fleet, we can safely escort our vessels across the seas. This also means that the time has come for us to think on a grander scale. Let us build vessels which rival even Britannia’s mightiest battlecarriers."
BWR_Standardized_Designs:0 "Standardize Designs"
	BWR_Standardized_Designs_desc:0 "We have successfully constructed multiple classes of surface fleet vessels. The expertise we have gained from this has shown us many of the flaws in our designs, some of which caused assembly to take longer than was necessary. As a result, we will finally be able to standardize our designs, allowing us to assemble light vessels faster than ever before."
BWR_Install_the_Repair_Yards:0 "Install Repair Yards"
	BWR_Install_the_Repair_Yards_desc:0 "With the possibility of war growing as the months pass by, the construction of dry dock repair yards would bolster our fleet’s survivability, allowing them to return to patrol without needing to wait months for repairs."
BWR_Flagship_for_the_Fleet:0 "A Flagship for the Fleet"
	BWR_Flagship_for_the_Fleet_desc:0 "What is a modern surface fleet without a flagship leading it? We could not in our right minds call ourselves a naval power without a crown for our fleet. Though we have enough resources to build such a ship, we only have enough for one capital vessel. The choice between a heavy cruiser or an aircraft carrier is currently giving rise to some rather heated debates among the admiralty."
BWR_Hidden_War:0 "The Hidden War"
	BWR_Hidden_War_desc:0 "With our nation being so limited in its production capabilities, it would be foolish of us to build a surface fleet for the sake of pride or ego. We should instead focus on predator tactics, remaining unnoticed until we strike our targets. A fleet of submarines would serve us better in the long run. Let us standardize their designs before anything else."
BWR_Fear_the_Unseen:0 "Fear the Unseen"
	BWR_Fear_the_Unseen_desc:0 "With a huge amount of time and effort saved by building smaller vessels, we can divert our efforts into updating our torpedoes’ capabilities and training our seamen to hold off on hitting a target until the last moment instead."
BWR_Lock_Down_the_Ocean:0 "Lock Down the Ocean"
	BWR_Lock_Down_the_Ocean_desc:0 "With our submarine designs standardized, it is time to increase the number of our patrols. This effort has been amplified by our new minelaying ships, which keep the areas around our nation on lockdown."
BWR_Mass-Produce_Parts:0 "Mass-Produce Parts"
	BWR_Mass-Produce_Parts_desc:0 "We cannot allow gaps in our patrols to form. To ensure that enemy ships cannot slip through our fleet, we must standardize the parts used to build our vessels themselves to increase the assembly speed of our submarines."
BWR_Deploy_the_Prototypes:0 "Deploy the Prototypes"
	BWR_Deploy_the_Prototypes_desc:0 "Specializing our naval production has finally paid off. The designers excitedly informed the admiralty that the new prototype submarines are ready to be let loose onto the sea. This came as a surprise to the admiralty, as they had not ordered or expected prototypes in any manner."

# Air Branch #
BWR_Air_Development:0 "Air Development"
	BWR_Air_Development_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that our air force is inadequate compared to those of the major powers of the world. We must correct this at once! Our aviation R&D department has been ordered to design new prototypes, both for weapons and Frame designs, to close the gap of power between us and our enemies."
BWR_Airbases:0 "Air Bases"
	BWR_Airbases_desc:0 "With new aircraft models being developed for our air force, we must create some airfields before we can begin assembly."
BWR_Air_Academy:0 "Found the Air Academy"
	BWR_Air_Academy_desc:0 "We have built ourselves an air force, but that is not enough to remain competitive in the war for the skies. We shall train our pilots to utilize the best tactics and strategies, bestowing them with so much knowledge that no foe shall best them in battle. They will become our guardians of the sky, and they shall know no fear."
BWR_Transport_Supplies:0 "Transport Supplies"
	BWR_Transport_Supplies_desc:0 "Times are changing. We can no longer depend solely on our ground infrastructure for the safe transportation of our supplies like we have been. After we pool together some funding, we will purchase some transport planes from the private sectors of other countries so that we may supply our forces without needing to depend on our roads and railways."
BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School:0 "Air Doctrine School"
	BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School_desc:0 "We need not look far to know we have much to learn in terms of aircraft and how to use them. Money has been spent, and books have been purchased; we shall use them to train our pilots."
BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School_2:0 "Air Doctrine School 2"
	BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School_2_desc:0 "We have learned some very valuable lessons in the time since our last meeting concerning the doctrine of our air force—lessons that have given us insight about how to proceed further with our pilots’ training."
BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School_3:0 "Air Doctrine School 3"
	BWR_aviation_Doctrine_School_3_desc:0 "Our nation has sufficiently acquainted itself with air combat to the point where our pilots have become as skilled as those serving the major powers. Why should we stop there? No, we will continue to apply what we’ve learned and improve our pilots’ skills even further. The stagnation of our air force would be tantamount to surrendering ourselves to the enemy should they choose to do the same."
BWR_Fighter_Focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
	BWR_Fighter_Focus_desc:0 "Bombers are powerful, yes, but they are slow and vulnerable. What our air force needs is not more bombers but a means to counter them as well as obliterate any aircraft that our enemies might choose to deploy."
BWR_Close_Air_Support:0 "Close Air Support"
	BWR_Close_Air_Support_desc:0 "The combined arms methodology can no longer be considered an optional doctrine. Combining air superiority with effective ground support is the best tactic for maintaining momentum in a battle. Ground support is best used in tandem with sudden air assaults. To make these combined arms maneuvers possible, we must have a foundation of close air support ready to fly at any time."
BWR_Bomber_Focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
	BWR_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "We have the industry required to support the most effective part of our air force: the bomber. These large machines of death can destroy our enemies’ backlines and turn the tides of battle for our soldiers on the frontlines."
BWR_Nothing_But_Ash:0 "Nothing but Ash"
	BWR_Nothing_But_Ash_desc:0 "Our air force’s primary goal should be to completely and utterly destroy our enemies’ ability to wage war. We shall endeavor to design the most powerful bombers the world has ever seen, and we will use them to target not just our enemies’ industries but their infrastructure as well, leaving their troops starved for supplies and vulnerable to our ground forces."

# Army Branch #
BWR_Army_Development:0 "Army Development"
	BWR_Army_Development_desc:0 "The time has come to reevaluate our military to prepare ourselves for the new age of warfare and research how we want to proceed."
BWR_Artillery_Development:0 "Artillery Development"
	BWR_Artillery_Development_desc:0 "Artillery has proven itself extremely effective in taking out the sturdiest of armies. To have an army without it in this day and age is not only unwise but incredibly stupid. We shall study reports from our troops in the field to develop better artillery."
BWR_Motorized_Development:0 "Motorized Development"
	BWR_Motorized_Development_desc:0 "The last few centuries have been a bastion of innovation and experimentation for warfare and technology. Among the many things learned, we have discovered the effectiveness of motorized equipment in an army. We shall pool together our scientists to advance our understanding of these simple yet very important machines."
BWR_Firearms_Development:0 "Firearms Development"
	BWR_Firearms_Development_desc:0 "What could be more important for an army than the humble gun? Even these fancy new Knightmares have their own guns. Thankfully, we can borrow knowledge from the private sector of other countries to help develop better firearms."
BWR_Armor_Development:0 "Armor Development"
	BWR_Armor_Development_desc:0 "Tanks are the only thing proving to be effective against Britannian Knightmares, and even then, they have been struggling. We must act quickly to develop better tanks to counter Knightmares."
BWR_New_RND_Department:0 "A New R&D Department"
	BWR_New_RND_Department_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that we need more scientists in order to keep up with our enemies. We have gathered the funds and the necessary people to establish a brand new research department to support our current ones."
BWR_army_Doctrine_School:0 "Army Doctrine School"
	BWR_army_Doctrine_School_desc:0 "Many important factors go into the creation of a successful military, but one of the most crucial is the command structure. We need effective officers and generals to be able to wage war; otherwise, our military would be incredibly ineffective and sluggish. We shall ensure only the most skilled and experienced people, and thus the most qualified, will be promoted."
BWR_army_Doctrine_School_2:0 "Army Doctrine School 2"
	BWR_army_Doctrine_School_2_desc:0 "Although armor is still prevalent presently, the future will very clearly be driven by Knightmares. Foot infantry will not survive in the coming age. If we wish for them to even survive first contact with the enemy, we must ensure they receive supplies of MANPATS, or man-portable anti-tank systems, to keep them alive and capable of fighting against any Knightmares or armored enemies."
BWR_army_Doctrine_School_3:0 "Army Doctrine School 3"
	BWR_army_Doctrine_School_3_desc:0 "With new Knightmare prototypes being unveiled yearly, we must discuss two variants: melee and fortress. Melee Knightmares sacrifice defensiveness for armor penetration and are able to form spearheads against most Knightmare variants. Fortress Knightmares don’t really have any offensive capabilities but are defensive powerhouses, requiring advanced Frames or anti-Knightmare artillery to take down."
BWR_army_Doctrine_School_4:0 "Army Doctrine School 4"
	BWR_army_Doctrine_School_4_desc:0 "The last Knightmare Frame variant we must address is the advanced, or so-called “all-purpose”, variant. This marvel, or terror, of technology is the one thing we should avoid at all costs. Only anti-Knightmare artillery have the capabilities to stop them. If our soldiers encounter one, they must know to either stand firm and wait for reinforcements or fall back to the main front. Do not engage."
BWR_army_Doctrine_School_5:0 "Army Doctrine School 5"
	BWR_army_Doctrine_School_5_desc:0 "Anti-Knightmare artillery have become a staple asset for fighting Knightmares. Whether we commit to one or the other, we must study ways to work with or against them. We could counter the artillery with intelligent tactics, such as having our infantry assault these unwieldy machines, or, if we utilize such weapons, place them at strategic points where our enemies would struggle to defeat them."
BWR_Knightmare_Warfare:0 "Knightmare Warfare"
	BWR_Knightmare_Warfare_desc:0 "A new age of warfare is upon us; we shall not let ourselves fall to the wayside. Knightmares are the way forward, and we will take full advantage of them by developing our own to compete with the major powers should the need arise."
BWR_The_Facts:0 "Spin the Facts"

BWR.1.t:0 "Puka's Lament"
	BWR.1.d:0 "Ever since Sonya adopted me, I had been treated with love and kindness, for she was different from many others. Never had a human shown such kindness to a cub who had been destined to die in the wilderness. I would be her loyal companion for the rest of our lives...at least, that’s what was supposed to happen.\n\nOn the night that Sonya was taken from me, I experienced the greatest sorrow that anyone could ever endure. Luka the Snake had betrayed her and twisted her beloved dream of equality for all into something sinister. It was on that night that my hatred for the hoomans had blossomed. His blood was the first I had ever tasted, his flesh the first I had ever torn, his life the first I had ever taken. My heart of thorns shall tighten and ensnare all of hoomanity's tyrants and restore Sonya’s honorable dream of equality for all of her children.\n\nSonya, the time in which I knew you was a blessing for me and my people. I swear to you: your dream shall become a reality. With one mighty roar, I shall unite the bears and march forth towards Espan’s Dawn. Please wait for me as you always did, for I will join you after your dream has been realized."
BWR.1.a:0 "Our people mourn for her."

BWR.2.t:0 "Remember Sonya"
	BWR.2.d:0 "“My fellow bears, today, we mourn the loss of our dearest comrade, Sonya. She was a mother to all bears and a true comrade of the revolution. She was killed right in front of me—the cubs, too. That tragedy taught me one thing: if the hoomans will mercilessly slaughter the best and kindest of their species, then they are not deserving of her world. But we will be.\n\nFirst, we shall take back our home, the country they tore apart for no other reason than their own greed and egos. Then we will carry our vision across the world. We cannot inherit Sonya's dream until the corruption of man is put in its place.\n\nMother, if you're watching, I know you will weep for your people. I am sorry, but the hoomans have shown us their true nature. Now, we will show them ours.”"
BWR.2.a:0 "She will never be forgotten."

BWR.3.t:0 "The New Face of Russia"
	BWR.3.d:0 "”My dear people, today, I stand before you as your leader, but I do not stand here alone. You have liberated and brought yourselves here to me after I sent the call. I cannot lead the revolution towards my own vision. That has been the most repeated failing of the hoomans, but it will not be ours.\n\nThere are those of us who have stood up on both hind legs in the birth of this new nation: Leventi Bearia, Wojtek, Bearkossky, Bearshchev, Bearakov, and Jean Bearie. These bears were the first to stand tall. Soon enough, you will all stand, for today is the birth of a new nation. Today is the birth of the Bear Workers Republic!”"
BWR.3.a:0 "Puka will rise!"

BWR.4.t:0 "Train the Bears for War"
	BWR.4.d:0 "Although our people are strong and have come far in the construction of this grand nation, they have yet to fully comprehend the hooman ways of war. Many soldiers still throw away their guns to claw and tear at the hoomans in their wake. This causes a lot of casualties on our enemy’s side; however, it leaves the pack vulnerable, and we do not have the population numbers to replenish every soldier lost.\n\nWe will teach them how to shoot, how to handle artillery, how to operate vehicles more reliably, and—when it is appropriate—how to go primal in close quarters."
BWR.4.a:0 "We must prepare quickly."

BWR.5.t:0 "Call Out to the International Bears"
	BWR.5.d:0 "We cannot even begin to hope to claim this world with our current numbers. We must reach out to our people around the world. Polar bears, sun bears, grizzly bears, koala bears, drop bears, black bears, brown bears, panda bears, and more—all are welcome in our republic. No matter where they may hail from, we will find a place for them in our great nation."
BWR.5.a:0 "Brothers and sisters unite!"

BWR.6.t:0 "Release the War Bears"
	BWR.6.d:0 "It is time to march forth. We have established our republic, and it now stands tall with the other nations of the world. However, the hoomans have not stood idly by as we’ve been finding our footing. We must act now before they can organize a collective response.\n\nWe shall put the hoomans in their place—the Europeans, the Asians, the Britannians, and all of their collective puppets."
BWR.6.a:0 "The time for peace is over."

BWR.7.t:0 "Establish Hooman Battalions"
	BWR.7.d:0 "With the hoomans now under our reign, we must find a way to care for them and make them part of the republic. Our initial plans were to open hooman zoos to let the people become more familiar with these creatures who simply cannot care for themselves. After all, they will soon be an endangered species. But war does not stop for the sake of kindness.\n\nIn a bid to utilize their tendency towards violence, we have created hooman battalions and have moved the tiny people into bearracks separated from the general public. They will soon be armed, trained, and thrown at the front lines, allowing us to keep our own people away from the most grizzly of battles."
BWR.7.a:0 "They must atone for their sins."

BWR.8.t:0 "Expand the Knightbears"
	BWR.8.d:0 "Our koala brothers have served our nation well on the frontlines, encircling many of the hoomans and catching many more off guard. The foolish hoomans always look to the skies in anticipation of our dangerous Knightbear Frames, but they never expect smaller versions running straight for them.\n\nDue to their immense value in the war effort, the grizzly department has focused on refitting their Knightbear Frames, allowing the koalas to stay in the thick of battle more reliably. No longer needing to focus on flank attacks and encirclements, our tiny brethren may now do as they’ve always wished: charge straight into the enemy alongside their larger comrades."
BWR.8.a:0 "It is time to honor our koala brothers."

BWR.9.t:0 "Espan’s Dawn"
	BWR.9.d:0 "I have prevented my soldiers from reaching the state of unbridled primal fury our people are capable of a countless number of times at this point. I can justify this restraint no longer. Although this republic had originally been formed to honor the memory of Sonya by ultimately showing the world the power of kindness, it could not hold up to such a lofty ideal. This world does not care for your wants or wishes. It is cold, harsh, and uncaring; its soil has been soaked with the blood of the innocent, and no one ever dared to utter a single word of defiance as the suffering of the innocent continued.\n\nThis is the world we were born in—the world Sonya was born in. The brightest members of hoomanity are often snuffed out by the darkest of their kind. In the end, actions carry more weight than ideals, and that solitary action shows the true, dastardly heart of hoomanity: a pit of darkness filled with nothing but bodies and greed. Their cruelty is matched only by their pride. Our new world—my new world—has no room for such people. We must fight until hoomanity has kneeled and accepted its status in the hierarchy of nature.\n\nMy dear carebear, I know you grieve for your people. You must regret saving me from starvation back then, but I have my own people to serve and my own dreams to bring to life now. Farewell, Sonya. We will ensure you do not remain lonely in the afterlife."
BWR.9.a:0 "Is this the right thing to do?"

BWR.10.t:0 "The Bearway to Heaven"
	BWR.10.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of the global republic. Borders and tribalism have all been made moot under our reign. The hoomans have been domesticated, and those remaining have been given protection status. We can finally make this world into a better place and care for those small, fragile beings along the way. I could not bring myself to end them. We have completely crushed any and all hooman resistance and their flawed societies. Total massacre would not bring glory to our grand republic. In fact, it would serve as nothing more than a stain: a stain on our people, a stain on our country, and worst of all, a stain on Espan, the Mighty One who had blessed us with the same thoughts and feelings that the hoomans share with each other. No one knows who or what our god is or what brought them to bless us with this self-realization. Maybe he was infuriated by the hoomans, or maybe it wasn’t on purpose.\n\nOver the years, we’ve discovered that some hoomans wield a special power called Geese. Perhaps the use of these powers birthed our rise to greatness, since we appear to be immune to them entirely. This is my personal belief anyway. Whatever its source, all bears were born knowing the name “Espan”. That singularly powerful name gave us sentience in the form of both a soul and consciousness. For that, we must be eternally grateful.\n\nSoon, we shall establish the hooman reserves, supplying them with food, water, and a chance to contribute what little they can to our glorious republic. Perhaps one day they will realize what brought about their downfall and will rise to stand beside us. Maybe another Sonya will shine brightly again in the future. I sadly will not be here long enough to see such a day. So, I will spend my remaining time in this world refining this republic that I love so dearly and enshrining its future, hopefully keeping the hoomans safe after I pass.\n\nThe time for bloodshed has passed. Now that we stand where the hoomans once did, repeating their mistakes would only serve to invalidate the years of war that I put both the hoomans and my people through. Never again."
BWR.10.a:0 "For Espan, Sonya, and all of bearkind!"
