### Focus Tree ###
remember_sonya:0 "Remember Sonya" 
remember_sonya_desc:0 "Our people have been deeply wounded by the passing of our dear Sonya. She may be gone, but her bears shall carry on her legacy. We shall fight for the freedom of all bears in due time. But today, we mourn. Let us have a day of peace before we march onward to our new world."
the_new_face_of_russia:0 "The New Face of Russia" 
the_new_face_of_russia_desc:0 "The time has come for the socialist movement to receive a fresh, new face they can all look to in times of desperation. What could be more socialist than a bear?"
bear_market:0 "Bear Market"
bear_market_desc:0 "We have taken up the mantle of the Bear Revolution, but we cannot bring about a revolution on bearpower alone. We will need to capture some hooman specialists and learn their methods of resource extraction if we are to spread our revolution far and wide and liberate all bears from the hoomans."
bear_economy:0 "Bear Economics"
bear_economy_desc:0 "Our republic must have a currency of its own. Therefore, by request of the people, the first industry we shall focus on building up is the fish industry. The workers will begin trading the eyes of fish for other goods. The republic is a nation of choice, and the people have chosen what holds value. Our currency will be known as the RFE, or the Republican fish eyes."
train_the_bears_for_war:0 "Train the Bears for War"
train_the_bears_for_war_desc:0 "In order to ensure the survival of the bear race, we must militarize our people in preparation for war with the hoomans. The Day of Espan’s Dawn shall soon be upon us."
bear_necessities:0 "Bear Necessities"
bear_necessities_desc:0 "With the birth of the republic, we have taken responsibility for the care of its people. Sonya had taught me many things, but one of the first was how people will fight for the land and home they love. The republic shall become that home. We shall meet our people’s needs and ensure that they receive proper shelter, sustenance, and safety until we are free to live as we wish in this world."
beary_good:0 "Beary Good!"
beary_good_desc:0 "Though our people are new to the concept of a workforce, they’re amazingly built for it. One bear is able to do the work of five men. As a result, our industries have easily outshone those of the hoomans. The hoomans were killing the planet to meet their needs; we only need to work hard to meet ours."
call_out_to_the_international_bears:0 "Call Out to the International Bears" 
call_out_to_the_international_bears_desc:0 "We have called out to our brothers and sisters around the world. They have arrived sooner than expected, their teeth and claws coated in blood as their rebirth was no different than ours. We can now train them, arm them, and teach them the hooman ways of war."
bear_revolution:0 "Bear Revolution"
bear_revolution_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that we cannot remain as just one nation. This land has limits in what it can sustain both agriculturally and population-wise. We must spread our republic across the borders of the world to restore the land back to how it once was when Espan first crafted it."
establish_the_polar_fleet:0 "Establish the Polar Fleet" 
establish_the_polar_fleet_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters to the north have demonstrated that ice patches are good for short-term naval travel. In order for us to expand the Polar Fleet, we must confiscate all vessels within the country, starting with those in the city of Vladivostok."
beary_good_navy:0 "Beary Good Navy" 
beary_good_navy_desc:0 "The Polar Fleet requires an upgrade. To achieve this, we have tasked our grizzly population with becoming the nation’s R&D department. Their sole objective is to bring us up to par with the hoomans, starting with our navy’s capabilities."  	
establish_knightbears:0 "Establish the Knightbears"
establish_knightbears_desc:0 "The Knightmare divisions that Britannia have deployed are almost perfect, but they contain a vital flaw: we cannot fit inside the cockpits. Thus, we have called upon our tiny friends from the Pacific, the koalas, to pilot them for us as our elite Knightbear force."
getting_our_bearings:0 "Getting Our Bearings"
getting_our_bearings_desc:0 "The hoomans have demonstrated the importance of a proper air force. As such, we believe that our sun bear brethren are fit for the job. We shall establish our bearings in the sky and protect our people from hooman bombardment."
bear_force_one:0 "Bear Force 1"
bear_force_one_desc:0 "To our delightful surprise, the hoomans cannot withstand our mighty sun bears’ piloting skills. Despite our might in the air, our bearplanes are too out-of-date for our pilots to fully utilize their talents. To remedy this, the grizzly researchers have come up with specially designed cockpits to give our pilots more room to move around inside, immediately fixing most of their skill issues."
release_the_war_bears:0 "Release the War Bears" 
release_the_war_bears_desc:0 "Our preparations for Operation Bearium, the operation to crush hoomanity, have been completed. The hoomans shall bear witness to our strength on this day as we overwhelm their fortifications and break their armies. The revolution shall not be stopped until the Earth becomes bearable once again."
sonya_will_be_avenged:0 "Sonya Will Be Avenged"
sonya_will_be_avenged_desc:0 "My beloved carebear, Sonya, had always taken care of her people. She taught me the value in the smallest of cubs. I know this, yet the image of that snake taking her life keeps flashing before my eyes. For that, we cannot let the hoomans go unpunished."
bears_are_unpawable:0 "The Unbearable Reality"
bears_are_unpawable_desc:0 "The hoomans believe that our conquest can be stopped. Their barbearic minds cannot comprehend the fact that their time as Earth’s dominant species is over. They have lost their not-so-rightful claim to the world."
beartial_law:0 "Martial Claw"
beartial_law_desc:0 "With the expansion of the republic continuing on all fronts, it’s time that we declare martial claw across the land. The hoomans will learn their place as Espan had once roared about in our history."
force_the_humans_to_fight:0 "Establish Hooman Battalions"
force_the_humans_to_fight_desc:0 "With a vast amount of the hoomans now belonging to our republic, the bear minimum that we require of them is for them to fight on our behalf. Why should we continue to waste waves of our own people when we have a massive reserve of hoomans to replace our losses?"
expand_the_knightbears:0 "Expand the Knightbears" 
expand_the_knightbears_desc:0 "With the hoomans expanding their Knightmares’ capabilities, the grizzly department has decided to focus their efforts on going beyond what the hoomans have managed. "
beartality:0 "Espan's Dawn"
beartality_desc:0 "The hoomans have cruelly molded the world into their image. It will take nothing less than the same level of beartality they had shown us in the past to help them see the new world we have molded for ourselves. Espan has blessed us with the power to break the last of the hoomans’ resistance with our Knightbear battalions.\nThis will be our day: the Day of Espan’s Dawn."



### Events ###
BWR.1.t:0 "Puka's Lament"
BWR.1.d:0 "Ever since Sonya adopted me, I had been treated with love and kindness, for she was different from many others. Never had a human shown such kindness to a cub who had been destined to die in the wilderness. I would be her loyal companion for the rest of our lives...at least, that’s what was supposed to happen.\n\nOn the night that Sonya was taken from me, I experienced the greatest sorrow that anyone could ever endure. Luka the Snake had betrayed her and twisted her beloved dream of equality for all into something sinister. It was on that night that my hatred for the hoomans had blossomed. His blood was the first I had ever tasted, his flesh the first I had ever torn, his life the first I had ever taken. My heart of thorns shall tighten and ensnare all of hoomanity's tyrants and restore Sonya’s honorable dream of equality for all of her children.\n\nSonya, the time in which I knew you was a blessing for me and my people. I swear to you: your dream shall become a reality. With one mighty roar, I shall unite the bears and march forth towards Espan’s Dawn. Please wait for me as you always did, for I will join you after your dream has been realized."
BWR.1.a:0 "ROAR!"

BWR.2.t:0 "Remember Sonya"
BWR.2.d:0 "“My fellow bears, today, we mourn the loss of our dearest comrade, Sonya. She was a mother to all bears and a true comrade of the revolution. She was killed right in front of me—the cubs, too. That tragedy taught me one thing: if the hoomans will mercilessly slaughter the best and kindest of their species, then they are not deserving of her world. But we will be.\n\nFirst, we shall take back our home, the country they tore apart for no other reason than their own greed and egos. Then we will carry our vision across the world. We cannot inherit Sonya's dream until the corruption of man is put in its place.\n\nMother, if you're watching, I know you will weep for your people. I am sorry, but the hoomans have shown us their true nature. Now, we will show them ours.”"

BWR.3.t:0 "The New Face of Russia"
BWR.3.d:0 "”My dear people, today, I stand before you as your leader, but I do not stand here alone. You have liberated and brought yourselves here to me after I sent the call. I cannot lead the revolution towards my own vision. That has been the most repeated failing of the hoomans, but it will not be ours.\n\nThere are those of us who have stood up on both hind legs in the birth of this new nation: Leventi Bearia, Wojtek, Bearkossky, Bearshchev, Bearakov, and Jean Bearie. These bears were the first to stand tall. Soon enough, you will all stand, for today is the birth of a new nation. Today is the birth of the URSA Workers Republic!”"

BWR.4.t:0 "Train the Bears for War"
BWR.4.d:0 "Although our people are strong and have come far in the construction of this grand nation, they have yet to fully comprehend the hooman ways of war. Many soldiers still throw away their guns to claw and tear at the hoomans in their wake. This causes a lot of casualties on our enemy’s side; however, it leaves the pack vulnerable, and we do not have the population numbers to replenish every soldier lost.\n\nWe will teach them how to shoot, how to handle artillery, how to operate vehicles more reliably, and—when it is appropriate—how to go primal in close quarters."
BWR.4.a:0 "player option"

BWR.5.t:0 "Call Out to the International Bears"
BWR.5.d:0 "We cannot even begin to hope to claim this world with our current numbers. We must reach out to our people around the world. Polar bears, sun bears, grizzly bears, koala bears, drop bears, black bears, brown bears, panda bears, and more—all are welcome in our republic. No matter where they may hail from, we will find a place for them in our great nation."
BWR.5.a:0 "player option"

BWR.6.t:0 "Release the War Bears"
BWR.6.d:0 "It is time to march forth. We have established our republic, and it now stands tall with the other nations of the world. However, the hoomans have not stood idly by as we’ve been finding our footing. We must act now before they can organize a collective response.\n\nWe shall put the hoomans in their place—the Europeans, the Asians, the Britannians, and all of their collective puppets."
BWR.6.a:0 "player option"

BWR.7.t:0 "Establish Hooman Battalions"
BWR.7.d:0 "With the hoomans now under our reign, we must find a way to care for them and make them part of the republic. Our initial plans were to open hooman zoos to let the people become more familiar with these creatures who simply cannot care for themselves. After all, they will soon be an endangered species. But war does not stop for the sake of kindness.\n\nIn a bid to utilize their tendency towards violence, we have created hooman battalions and have moved the tiny people into bearracks separated from the general public. They will soon be armed, trained, and thrown at the front lines, allowing us to keep our own people away from the most grizzly of battles."
BWR.7.a:0 "player option"

BWR.8.t:0 "Expand the Knightbears"
BWR.8.d:0 "Our koala brothers have served our nation well on the frontlines, encircling many of the hoomans and catching many more off guard. The foolish hoomans always look to the skies in anticipation of our dangerous Knightbear Frames, but they never expect smaller versions running straight for them.\n\nDue to their immense value in the war effort, the grizzly department has focused on refitting their Knightbear Frames, allowing the koalas to stay in the thick of battle more reliably. No longer needing to focus on flank attacks and encirclements, our tiny brethren may now do as they’ve always wished: charge straight into the enemy alongside their larger comrades."
BWR.8.a:0 "player option"

BWR.9.t:0 "Espan’s Dawn"
BWR.9.d:0 "I have prevented my soldiers from reaching the state of unbridled primal fury our people are capable of a countless number of times at this point. I can justify this restraint no longer. Although this republic had originally been formed to honor the memory of Sonya by ultimately showing the world the power of kindness, it could not hold up to such a lofty ideal. This world does not care for your wants or wishes. It is cold, harsh, and uncaring; its soil has been soaked with the blood of the innocent, and no one ever dared to utter a single word of defiance as the suffering of the innocent continued.\n\nThis is the world we were born in—the world Sonya was born in. The brightest members of hoomanity are often snuffed out by the darkest of their kind. In the end, actions carry more weight than ideals, and that solitary action shows the true, dastardly heart of hoomanity: a pit of darkness filled with nothing but bodies and greed. Their cruelty is matched only by their pride. Our new world—my new world—has no room for such people. We must fight until hoomanity has kneeled and accepted its status in the hierarchy of nature.\n\nMy dear carebear, I know you grieve for your people. You must regret saving me from starvation back then, but I have my own people to serve and my own dreams to bring to life now. Farewell, Sonya. We will ensure you do not remain lonely in the afterlife."

BWR.10.t:0 "The Bearway to Heaven"
BWR.10.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of the global republic. Borders and tribalism have all been made moot under our reign. The hoomans have been domesticated, and those remaining have been given protection status. We can finally make this world into a better place and care for those small, fragile beings along the way. I could not bring myself to end them. We have completely crushed any and all hooman resistance and their flawed societies. Total massacre would not bring glory to our grand republic. In fact, it would serve as nothing more than a stain: a stain on our people, a stain on our country, and worst of all, a stain on Espan, the Mighty One who had blessed us with the same thoughts and feelings that the hoomans share with each other. No one knows who or what our god is or what brought them to bless us with this self-realization. Maybe he was infuriated by the hoomans, or maybe it wasn’t on purpose. Over the years, we’ve discovered that some hoomans wield a special power called Geese. Perhaps the use of these powers birthed our rise to greatness, since we appear to be immune to them entirely. This is my personal belief anyway. Whatever its source, all bears were born knowing the name “Espan”. That singularly powerful name gave us sentience in the form of both a soul and consciousness. For that, we must be eternally grateful.\n\nSoon, we shall establish the hooman reserves, supplying them with food, water, and a chance to contribute what little they can to our glorious republic. Perhaps one day they will realize what brought about their downfall and will rise to stand beside us. Maybe another Sonya will shine brightly again in the future. I sadly will not be here long enough to see such a day. So, I will spend my remaining time in this world refining this republic that I love so dearly and enshrining its future, hopefully keeping the hoomans safe after I pass. The time for bloodshed has passed. Now that we stand where they once did, repeating their mistakes would only serve to invalidate the years of war I put both the hoomans and my people through. Never again."
