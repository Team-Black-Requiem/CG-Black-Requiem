BWR.1.t:0 "Puka's Lament"
BWR.1.d:0 "Ever since Sonya adopted me, I had been treated with love and kindness, for she was different from many others. Never had a human shown such kindness to a cub who had been destined to die in the wilderness. I would be her loyal companion for the rest of our lives...at least, that's what was supposed to happen. \nOn the night that Sonya was taken from me, I experienced the greatest sorrow that anyone could ever endure. Luka the Snake had betrayed her and twisted her beloved dream of equality for all into something sinister. It was on that night that my hatred for the hoomans had blossomed. His blood was the first I had ever tasted, his flesh the first I had ever torn, his life the first I had ever taken. My heart of thorns shall tighten and ensnare all of hoomanity's tyrants and restore Sonya's honorable dream of equality for all of her children.\nThe time in which I knew you was a blessing for me and my people. I swear to you, Sonya, your dream shall become a reality. With one mighty roar, I shall unite the bears and march forth towards Espan's Dawn. Please wait for me as you always did, for I will join you after your dream has been realized. \n ROAR!"

BWR.2.t:0 "Remember Sonya"
BWR.2.d:0 "My fellow bears, today, we mourn the loss of our dearest comrade, Sonya. She was a mother to all bears and a true comrade of the revolution. She was killed right in front of me—the cubs, too. That tragedy taught me one thing, if the hoomans will mercilessly slaughter the best and kindest of their species, then they are not deserving of her world. But we will be. First, we shall take back our home, the country they tore apart for no other reason than their own greed and egos. Then we will carry our vision across the world. We cannot inherit Sonya's dream until the corruption of man is put in its place. Mother, if you're watching, I know you will weep for your people. I am sorry, but the hoomans have shown us their true nature. Now, we will show them ours."

BWR.3.t:0 "The New Face of Russia"
BWR.3.d:0 "My dear people, today, I stand before you as your leader, but I do not stand here alone. You have liberated and brought yourselves here to me after I sent the call. I cannot lead the revolution towards my own vision. That has been the most repeated failing of the hoomans, but it will not be ours. There are those of us who have stood up on both hind legs in the birth of this new nation, Eventi Bearia, Wojtek, Bearkovsky, Bearshchev, Comrade Bearakov, and Jean Bearie. These bears were the first to stand tall. Soon enough, you will all stand, for today is the birth of a new nation. Today is the birth of the URSA Workers Republic!"

BWR.4.t:0 "Train the Bears for War"
BWR.4.d:0 "Although our people are strong and have come far in the construction of this grand nation, they have yet to fully comprehend the hooman ways of war. Many soldiers still throw away their guns to claw and tear at the hoomans in their wake. This causes a lot of casualties on our enemy’s side; however, it leaves the pack vulnerable, and we do not have the population numbers to replenish every soldier lost. We will teach them how to shoot, how to handle artillery, how to operate vehicles more reliably, and—when it is appropriate—how to go primal in close quarters."

BWR.5.t:0 "Call Out to the International Bears"
BWR.5.d:0 "We cannot even begin to hope to claim this world with our current numbers. We must reach out to our people around the world. Polar bears, sun bears, grizzly bears, koala bears, drop bears, black bears, brown bears, panda bears, and more—all are welcome in our republic. No matter where they may hail from, we will find a place for them in our great nation."

BWR.6.t:0 "Release the War Bears"
BWR.6.d:0 "It is time to march forth. We have established our republic, and it now stands tall with the other nations of the world. However, the hoomans have not stood idly by as we’ve been finding our footing. We must act now before they can organize a collective response. We shall put the hoomans in their place—the Europeans, the Asians, the Britannians, and all of their collective puppets."

BWR.7.t:0 "Establish Hooman Battalions"
BWR.7.d:0 "With the hoomans now under our reign, we must find a way to care for them and make them part of the republic. Our initial plans were to open hooman zoos to let the people become more familiar with these creatures who simply cannot care for themselves. After all, they will soon be an endangered species. But war does not stop for the sake of kindness. In a bid to utilize their tendency towards violence, we have created hooman battalions and have moved the tiny people into bearracks separated from the general public. They will soon be armed, trained, and thrown at the front lines, allowing us to keep our own people away from the most grizzly of battles."
BWR.7.a:0 "player option"

BWR.8.t:0 "Expand the Knightbears"
BWR.8.d:0 "Our koala brothers have served our nation well on the frontlines, encircling many of the hoomans and catching many more off guard. The foolish hoomans always look to the skies in anticipation of our dangerous Knightbear Frames, but they never expect smaller versions running straight for them. Due to their immense value in the war effort, the grizzly department has focused on refitting their Knightbear Frames, allowing the koalas to stay in the thick of battle more reliably. No longer needing to focus on flank attacks and encirclements, our tiny brethren may now do as they’ve always wished, charge straight into the enemy alongside their larger comrades."

BWR.9.t:0 "Espan’s Dawn"
BWR.9.d:0 "I have prevented my soldiers from wielding the unbridled primal reach our people hold a countless number of times at this point. I can justify this restraint no longer. Although this republic had originally been formed to honor the memory of Sonya by ultimately showing the world the power of kindness, it could not hold up to such a lofty ideal. This world does not care for your wants or wishes. It is cold, harsh, and uncaring; its soil has been soaked with the blood of the innocent, and no one ever dared to utter even a single word of defiance as the suffering of the innocent continued. This is the world we were born in—the world Sonya was born in. The brightest members of hoomanity are often snuffed out by the darkest of their kind. In the end, actions carry more weight than ideals, and that solitary action shows the true, dastardly heart of hoomanity, a pit of darkness filled with nothing but bodies and greed. Their cruelty is matched only by their pride.
\n
Our new world—my new world—has no room for such people. We must fight until hoomanity has kneeled and accepted its status in the hierarchy of nature. My dear carebear, I know you grieve for your people. You must regret saving me from starvation back then, but I have my own people to serve and my own dreams to bring to life now. Farewell, Sonya. We will ensure you do not remain lonely in the afterlife."
