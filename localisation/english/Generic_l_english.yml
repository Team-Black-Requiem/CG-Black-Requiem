### Focus Tree ###

# Political Branch #
gen_exploring_our_options:0 "Explore Our Options"
	gen_exploring_our_options_desc:0 "We may be restricted in the changes we can make to our nation, but we can at least decide how we will run things internally. Ideology should not limit a nation when it is surrounded by powers that, if willing, could snuff it out with a single breath."
gen_authoritarianism:0 "Authoritarianism"
	gen_authoritarianism_desc:0 "We have assumed complete control over the nation. Some may say it’s by force; others believe it’s due to the people trusting in us to provide them safety. Either way, we will make the most out of the current situation."
gen_tolalitarian_socialism:0 "Totalitarian Socialism"
	gen_tolalitarian_socialism_desc:0 "A totalitarian government tries to completely control the lives of its citizens through propaganda and coercion all in the name of protecting its socialist ideals. Though the state may at times make an effort to uplift its people, it spends the rest of its time cementing its control over the nation."
gen_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
	gen_secret_police_desc:0 "We cannot guarantee that our people won’t be affected by foreign influence. The world is full of expansionist nations who do not respect borders or culture. To protect ourselves and our people, a government-loyal police force that can operate quietly and beyond the law’s judicial reach is needed."
gen_command_economy:0 "Commandeer the Economy"
	gen_command_economy_desc:0 "It is a government's duty to guide its people; that responsibility also extends to the economy. We must nationalize our corporations and unions. To keep the nation heading in the right direction, we must employ the people ourselves."
gen_autocracy:0 "Autocracy"
	gen_autocracy_desc:0 "An autocratic government has one ruler who assumes absolute control over the nation and makes any and all decisions for it. Autocracies have existed since the days of kings and city-states. It proves itself a strong form of government when quick decisions are needed, but it leads to one person being able to take a country down whatever path they choose regardless of whether the people are in agreement with them."
gen_I_am_the_law:0 "I Am the Law"
	gen_I_am_the_law_desc:0 "The maintenance of law and order is essential to a nation's stability. The people know and respect this tenet of society. They know that I will guide them through any dark times we may face, but to do so, I must be unshackled by the laws that restrain lesser men. After all, I wrote the law, and I changed the constitution. At this point, I am the law."
gen_appointed_ministers:0 "Appointed Ministers"
	gen_appointed_ministers_desc:0 "One person cannot rule alone, but they can choose their advisors. The power to dismiss dissenting ministers is a necessary power for maintaining political unity. Though if I'm being honest with myself, being able to silence the ministers’ posturing and bickering is a right that I’m grateful for."
gen_nationalism:0 "Ultranationalism"
	gen_nationalism_desc:0 "An ultranationalist government exerts total authority over its people and any nation it controls, whether by using an occupying military force or applying economic pressure where it’s needed. The populists’ belief in their nation's superiority and right to control others justifies their expansionist foreign policy."
gen_mandated_draft:0 "Mandated Draft"
	gen_mandated_draft_desc:0 "It is a state's responsibility to serve its people, and in turn, it is the people’s duty to serve the state and to fight for its honor, its prosperity, and its hegemony. Citizens who prove unwilling to give back to the state have shown a tremendous amount of disrespect both to the nation and their fellow citizens and shall be dealt with accordingly."
gen_expansionist_economy:0 "Expansionist Economy"
	gen_expansionist_economy_desc:0 "Our nation's influence extends beyond our borders. We must keep a standing army at the ready at all times so that we can enforce our claims and punish anyone who attempts to cut us down. To maintain these holdings, our economy must serve the army first, supplying them with everything they need to keep our country great."
gen_state_first_mentality:0 "State First Mentality"
	gen_state_first_mentality_desc:0 "The people are merely a group of things that the state requires to survive. Educating the populace to ensure they know that the state comes first and that their allegiance is to the state and only the state will be mandatory for our regime’s influence."
gen_third_way:0 "Take the Middle Road"
	gen_third_way_desc:0 "Committing ourselves to a single ideology is foolish. We can enjoy the best of both worlds while suffering no drawbacks. Mixing authoritarianism and liberalism has never gone wrong in the past, right?"
gen_hardline_socialism:0 "Hardline Socialism"
	gen_hardline_socialism_desc:0 "A hardline socialist society unwaveringly protects their community-owned means of production and distribution at all costs, ensuring that every citizen remains on an equal footing with one another no matter what their situation happens to be on an individual level. If anyone dares to disrupt the flow of this society in any way, they will be exiled from the nation forcefully by their neighbors."
gen_government_unions:0 "Government Unions"
	gen_government_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions, if left unsupervised, could threaten the very foundation of our nation. We must do something about them as a nation before they become a national security risk. How about we have them be administered by the state?"
gen_the_means_of_production:0 "The Means of Production"
	gen_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "The people are controlled by only one thing, and that is the consumer mindset. We must liberate them from this soulless desire and give them the means for their own survival, enabling them to better their lives under our government’s rule."
gen_authoritarian_dem:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
	gen_authoritarian_dem_desc:0 "An authoritarian democracy can only be described as the paradoxical overreach of corporations and the wealthy. They advocate on behalf of entire groups while retaining their power through lobbying. The public accepts this as they are afforded the comfort of getting to vote for the representatives that these powerful men and women influence."
gen_getting_the_logs:0 "Radical Logging"
	gen_getting_the_logs_desc:0 "Some individuals in our own nation may take it upon themselves to openly resist and defy the government. We should keep track of these subversive elements and log their activities in case there are any problems caused by the actions of these radical elements in the future."
gen_regulating_entry:0 "Regulating Entry"
	gen_regulating_entry_desc:0 "We need to regulate our economy. Foreign corporations cannot be allowed to continue running loose unrestricted while our people suffer from their greedy actions. Therefore, we must reign in their influence so that they aren’t as powerful as our state-owned companies."
gen_one_party_one_state:0 "One Party, One State"
	gen_one_party_one_state_desc:0 "Our political institution can only really operate when one party controls every aspect of the government. If there’s any opposition, it would hinder the governance of the nation and the people—a truly horrifying thought indeed."
gen_liberalism:0 "Liberalism"
	gen_liberalism_desc:0 "Liberals are a rare thing in this day in age because Emperor Charles zi Britannia directly suffocates any nation that represents itself as an open society. Only the EU and a handful of other nations dare to even dip their toes into liberalist ideas."
gen_moderate_conservatism:0 "Moderate Conservatism"
	gen_moderate_conservatism_desc:0 "Conservatism has become the new “left” of this world. It’s the safest way for a nation to avoid the wrath of the Chinese and the Britannians without needing to entirely reform the nation’s structure to meet their demands. This does force a nation into stagnancy, but it keeps them invisible to the rest of the world."
gen_corruption_free_statesmen:0 "Corruption-Free Statesmen"
	gen_corruption_free_statesmen_desc:0 "It has become increasingly evident that some of our fellow statesmen are corrupt to the core. These people shall be found unfit for office as they have openly used their positions as public officials for their own profit."
gen_fear_of_change:0 "Fear of Change"
	gen_fear_of_change_desc:0 "People are frightened of what the nation is becoming, so we must assure them it is all for the better. We must work towards a better future for all of us; only then can we prosper as both a nation and a people."
gen_moderate_liberalism:0 "Moderate Liberalism"
	gen_moderate_liberalism_desc:0 "With monarchs ruling the world and the EU adopting the idea of an authoritarian democracy among their members, any sort of politically centered state becomes a liberal haven by comparison. Though these nations are liberal in name only, their relaxed ideologies make them the safest places to live."
gen_employment_as_a_right:0 "Employment as a Right"
	gen_employment_as_a_right_desc:0 "Unemployment is rife within our economy. We need to get the people back to work not only to improve our economy but also to improve their lives. Working is a natural right for any person within our nation."
gen_times_of_change:0 "Time for Change"
	gen_times_of_change_desc:0 "Our nation is truly changing for the better. The time for change will be upon us soon. We shall become a nation where our people are all equal and safe from war, famine, poverty, and corruption. A better tomorrow awaits us."
gen_moderate_socialism:0 "Moderate Socialism"
	gen_moderate_socialism_desc:0 "While socialism remains a long-term goal, moderate socialists are more concerned about curbing capitalism's excesses and have been supportive of recent progressive reforms that humanize companies and the government."
gen_a_united_front:0 "A United Front"
	gen_a_united_front_desc:0 "Radical political forces have become prevalent in our country as of late. We must form a united front so that we can rally together against authoritarianism and any other ideology that seeks to destroy what we stand for!"
gen_international_trade:0 "International Trade"
	gen_international_trade_desc:0 "We must embrace international trade to better our economy and establish friendly trading ties with other nations. These ties will surely benefit us in the future, but in the meantime, we shall be supplied with the finest of silks."
gen_individual_rights:0 "Individual Rights"
	gen_individual_rights_desc:0 "A nation cannot exist without its people. People make up the very foundation of a nation-state, and the state serves the people as a representative body in return. All for one, and one for all!"
gen_our_own_block:0 "Our Own Bloc"
	gen_our_own_block_desc:0 "With our nation now going down a path of our own making, we have enough stability and internal strength to maintain our sovereignty, even if we become a puppet state or enter into a multinational alliance."

# Economy Branch #
gen_Industrial_Development:0 "Industrial Development"
	gen_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "Our nation desperately needs an industrial overhaul. We need to invest in better systems of industrialization to uplift our nation out of the economic disparity we’ve found ourselves in during these uncertain times."
Civillian_Sector:0 "Civilian Sector"
	Civillian_Sector_desc:0 "The time has come for us to build new factories from the ground up. With this, our nation can reach the quotas and sustainability necessary to become an economic powerhouse."
Civilian_Sector_2:0 "Civilian Sector 2"
	Civilian_Sector_2_desc:0 "As a continuation of our current economic policy, the government shall invest in more state-owned factories in order to boost the economy of the nation and work towards the long-term economic prosperity of our people."
Civilian_Sector_3:0 "Civilian Sector 3"
	Civilian_Sector_3_desc:0 "To accomplish the medium-term goals of our economic plan, we shall continue our focus on the construction of factories to meet the demands for our growing consumer industry."
Civillian_Sector_4:0 "Civilian Sector 4"
	Civillian_Sector_4_desc:0 "As the final steps of our economic plan come to fruition, the magnum opus for uplifting our country into wealth and prosperity is finally ready to be initiated! In the very near future, the nations of the world shall bow before our sheer economic power!"
Infastructure_Sector:0 "Infrastructure Sector"
	Infastructure_Sector_desc:0 "Our nation’s infrastructure has become dilapidated as past corruption and ignorance had made us neglect its maintenance for some time. We must launch an initiative to fix and expand our infrastructure so that we can restore it to its former glory."
Infastructure_Sector_2:0 "Infrastructure Sector 2"
	Infastructure_Sector_2_desc:0 "The next stage of our infrastructure development may now begin. We shall work towards building a sustainable nationwide transportation system to supply our military and the general populace for many years to come."
Infastructure_Sector_3:0 "Infrastructure Sector 3"
	Infastructure_Sector_3_desc:0 "We must keep up the momentum we’ve gained so far. We shall clear up the old infrastructure to make way for new homes, factories, and facilities that will reinforce the very foundations of our nation."
Infastructure_Sector_4:0 "Infrastructure Sector 4"
	Infastructure_Sector_4_desc:0 "At last, the final phase of our infrastructure development plan shall commence. Our capital city will become self-sustainable for the foreseeable future, and its economy shall truly reflect that of a rising nation’s capital city."
Military_Sector:0 "Military Sector"
	Military_Sector_desc:0 "In order to be able to properly defend ourselves from exterior threats, we need an arms industry capable of supplying our infantry with weapons reliable enough to combat the ever-growing hostile forces that seek to undermine our stability as a nation."
Military_Sector_2:0 "Military Sector 2"
	Military_Sector_2_desc:0 "Another aspect we must consider is the large amounts of armor divisions our enemies may field. Let alone the possibility of facing knightmares. A technology that is quickly showing a new face of war and is developing rapidly into something beyond armor. We must invest in our artillery and anti tank capabilities. If we are to hold our own against such technological might."
Military_Sector_3:0 "Military Sector 3"
	Military_Sector_3_desc:0 "The skies are a theater of combat often overlooked in battle, but even so, we can clearly see that whoever controls the skies controls the flow of battle. Producing aircraft capable of guaranteeing our superiority in the sky is of utmost priority."
Military_Sector_4:0 "Military Sector 4"
	Military_Sector_4_desc:0 "Our final military industrial expansion shall greatly increase our military production and advance our military technology, ensuring our sovereignty and the continued protection of our nation."
New_Technical_Institute:0 "A New Technical Institute"
	New_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "Our recent industrial expansion has afforded us the opportunity to increase our research and development budget, which will allow us to rapidly expand our innovative capabilities and further our long-term national goals."
Synthethic_Sources:0 "Synthetic Sources"
	Synthethic_Sources_desc:0 "In order to fuel our growing industry, we need the resources to be able to properly sustain ourselves while continuing the expansion of our industry and innovating new technologies capable of aiding with our industrial expansion."
Civillian_Sector_5:0 "Civilian Sector 5"
	Civillian_Sector_5_desc:0 "Our second national industrial plan has been set in motion. The factories we shall erect here will provide the means that the state needs in order to secure our economic independence."
Prosperous_Nation:0 "A Prosperous Nation"
	Prosperous_Nation_desc:0 "Finally, our nation has reached true prosperity. Our people live off of the wealth provided to them from the recent expansion of our national economic industry. We have achieved what lesser nations could only dream of."
Pink_Saphires:0 "Pink Sapphires?"
	Pink_Saphires_desc:0 "Sakuradite is a precious resource which we cannot afford to forgo. Other nations use this resource to greatly advance their capabilities as a nation both economically and militarily. We need this resource, and we need it now!"
New_Railways:0 "New Railways"
	New_Railways_desc:0 "To ensure our nation is capable of not only defending itself but also sustaining itself economically, we need to construct a railway network capable of meeting our needs as a growing nation on the cusp of innovation."
Military_Sector_5:0 "Military Sector 5"
	Military_Sector_5_desc:0 "Now that we have the resources capable of enacting our second military expansion, we can truly equip our military with all sorts of equipment. We shall have one of—no, the best equipped military in the world!"
Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
	Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "Our nation’s economic future is edging closer and closer to a militaristically centered one. Our war machine will continue to grow; can we sustain it indefinitely, or will it lead to our downfall?"
Advanced_Technical_Institute:0 "Advanced Technical Institute"
	Advanced_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "The recent growth of our industry has given us an increase in our capacity to innovate and improve upon our current technologies. We will gain the edge on other nations who believe themselves superior to us technologically."

# Navy Branch #
gen_Establish_Admiralty:0 "Establish the Admiralty"
	gen_Establish_Admiralty_desc:0 "It is finally time for our nation to reach out beyond our coastline. Before we can even consider sending ships out, we must establish both the admiralty and the chain of command. We only have a few men and women capable of filling this role within our nation. Let us hope they’re up to the challenge."
gen_Confiscate_Dockyards:0 "Confiscate Civilian Dockyards"
	gen_Confiscate_Dockyards_desc:0 "Though trade is vital to us in this uncertain time, we cannot sit idly by as the giants stomp around us, for it will only be a matter of time before we are the ones being stomped. We will confiscate ports, harbors, and any man-made outcroppings that are used for boat repairs. This makeshift collection of dockyards shall provide us with the ability to produce our own vessels of war."
gen_Naval_School:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
	gen_Naval_School_desc:0 "Now that we have a high admiral and a few vessels in the beginning stages of construction, we must establish an academy to train seamen into officers so that we can fill out the rest of the ranks in our command structure."
gen_New_Age:0 "The New Age of Naval Warfare"
	gen_New_Age_desc:0 "Although ship designs have not been altered much over the years, the tactics and roles for each ship class have changed drastically. We must catch up on our naval doctrines; otherwise, there is a significant chance that we may be caught unawares in our very first battle."
gen_Coastal_Defense_Fleet:0 "Establish the Coastal Defense Fleet"
	gen_Coastal_Defense_Fleet_desc:0 "With our production capabilities growing and our command structure firmly established, we can now distribute our first task to the navy. The goal of this task is nothing tougher than patrolling along our coastline to give the crew some experience on the sea. Though this may seem like a minor mission on the surface, it has successfully bolstered our nation's pride and hope."
gen_Honorable_Battle:0 "The Honorable Tides of Battle"
	gen_Honorable_Battle_desc:0 "Our nation is too prideful and honorable to hide beneath the waves like a skulking predator. We will stand tall and head towards our enemies with the might and grandeur once held by the fleets of old. We will pummel them with our formidable armaments."
gen_Heavy_Ship_Design:0 "Heavy Ship Designs"
	gen_Heavy_Ship_Design_desc:0 "Now that we have a strong screening fleet, we can safely escort our vessels across the seas. This also means that the time has come for us to think on a grander scale. Let us build vessels which rival even Britannia’s mightiest battlecarriers."
gen_Standardized_Designs:0 "Standardize Designs"
	gen_Standardized_Designs_desc:0 "We have successfully constructed multiple classes of surface fleet vessels. The expertise we have gained from this has shown us many of the flaws in our designs, some of which caused assembly to take longer than was necessary. As a result, we will finally be able to standardize our designs, allowing us to assemble light vessels faster than ever before."
gen_Install_the_Repair_Yards:0 "Install Repair Yards"
	gen_Install_the_Repair_Yards_desc:0 "With the possibility of war growing as the months pass by, the construction of dry dock repair yards would bolster our fleet’s survivability, allowing them to return to patrol without needing to wait months for repairs."
gen_Flagship_for_the_Fleet:0 "A Flagship for the Fleet"
	gen_Flagship_for_the_Fleet_desc:0 "What is a modern surface fleet without a flagship leading it? We could not in our right minds call ourselves a naval power without a crown for our fleet. Though we have enough resources to build such a ship, we only have enough for one capital vessel. The choice between a heavy cruiser or an aircraft carrier is currently giving rise to some rather heated debates among the admiralty."
gen_Hidden_War:0 "The Hidden War"
	gen_Hidden_War_desc:0 "With our nation being so limited in its production capabilities, it would be foolish of us to build a surface fleet for the sake of pride or ego. We should instead focus on predator tactics, remaining unnoticed until we strike our targets. A fleet of submarines would serve us better in the long run. Let us standardize their designs before anything else."
gen_Fear_the_Unseen:0 "Fear the Unseen"
	gen_Fear_the_Unseen_desc:0 "With a huge amount of time and effort saved by building smaller vessels, we can divert our efforts into updating our torpedoes’ capabilities and training our seamen to hold off on hitting a target until the last moment instead."
gen_Lock_Down_the_Ocean:0 "Lock Down the Ocean"
	gen_Lock_Down_the_Ocean_desc:0 "With our submarine designs standardized, it is time to increase the number of our patrols. This effort has been amplified by our new minelaying ships, which keep the areas around our nation on lockdown."
gen_Mass-Produce_Parts:0 "Mass-Produce Parts"
	gen_Mass-Produce_Parts_desc:0 "We cannot allow gaps in our patrols to form. To ensure that enemy ships cannot slip through our fleet, we must standardize the parts used to build our vessels themselves to increase the assembly speed of our submarines."
gen_Deploy_the_Prototypes:0 "Deploy the Prototypes"
	gen_Deploy_the_Prototypes_desc:0 "Specializing our naval production has finally paid off. The designers excitedly informed the admiralty that the new prototype submarines are ready to be let loose onto the sea. This came as a surprise to the admiralty, as they had not ordered or expected prototypes in any manner."

# Air Branch #
gen_Air_Development:0 "Air Development"
	gen_Air_Development_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that our air force is inadequate compared to those of the major powers of the world. We must correct this at once! Our aviation R&D department has been ordered to design new prototypes, both for weapons and Frame designs, to close the gap of power between us and our enemies."
gen_Airbases:0 "Air Bases"
	gen_Airbases_desc:0 "With new aircraft models being developed for our air force, we must create some airfields before we can begin assembly."
gen_Air_Academy:0 "Found the Air Academy"
	gen_Air_Academy_desc:0 "We have built ourselves an air force, but that is not enough to remain competitive in the war for the skies. We shall train our pilots to utilize the best tactics and strategies, bestowing them with so much knowledge that no foe shall best them in battle. They will become our guardians of the sky, and they shall know no fear."
gen_Transport_Supplies:0 "Transport Supplies"
	gen_Transport_Supplies_desc:0 "Times are changing. We can no longer depend solely on our ground infrastructure for the safe transportation of our supplies like we have been. After we pool together some funding, we will purchase some transport planes from the private sectors of other countries so that we may supply our forces without needing to depend on our roads and railways."
gen_aviation_Doctrine_School:0 "Air Doctrine School"
	gen_aviation_Doctrine_School_desc:0 "We need not look far to know we have much to learn in terms of aircraft and how to use them. Money has been spent, and books have been purchased; we shall use them to train our pilots."
gen_aviation_Doctrine_School_2:0 "Air Doctrine School 2"
	gen_aviation_Doctrine_School_2_desc:0 "We have learned some very valuable lessons in the time since our last meeting concerning the doctrine of our air force—lessons that have given us insight about how to proceed further with our pilots’ training."
gen_aviation_Doctrine_School_3:0 "Air Doctrine School 3"
	gen_aviation_Doctrine_School_3_desc:0 "Our nation has sufficiently acquainted itself with air combat to the point where our pilots have become as skilled as those serving the major powers. Why should we stop there? No, we will continue to apply what we’ve learned and improve our pilots’ skills even further. The stagnation of our air force would be tantamount to surrendering ourselves to the enemy should they choose to do the same."
gen_Fighter_Focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
	gen_Fighter_Focus_desc:0 "Bombers are powerful, yes, but they are slow and vulnerable. What our air force needs is not more bombers but a means to counter them as well as obliterate any aircraft that our enemies might choose to deploy."
gen_Close_Air_Support:0 "Close Air Support"

Combining air superiority with effective ground support is the best tactic for maintaining momentum in a battle. Ground support is best used in tandem with sudden air assaults.

	GEN.1.d:0 "The sheer amount of progress we have made since establishing the admiralty have been truly staggering. The technologies and experience we have accumulated since forging our first naval vessel have finally led up to this very moment. The time has come to forge a vessel that shall act as our pride of the fleet. It shall be a symbol that our entire navy can rally around during battles on the high seas. Our enemies will learn to fear this vessel and shall quake in terror at the mere sight of its emergence on the horizon.\n\nHowever, the admiralty is split on the issue of what kind of vessel we will pursue the development of. Two factions have emerged, one favoring a heavy cruiser that would lead our fleet against the enemies of our nation and the other advocating for an aircraft carrier to protect our fleet and guide it during battle. Whatever the outcome, we will rule the high seas in style!"
