#Events
area11.1.t:0 "Orders From Bismark"
area11.1.d:0 "As we are beginning the process of erasing the old Japanese identity and administration, the SRA has ordered the overwrite of the old Japanese legal and judicial code, in favor of a version similar to the Homeland one. Despite this, we have to consider the ongoing insurgency and the very low support from locals and Britannians alike in the Area.\n\nIndeed, the administration must decide if the new code will be instantly enacted all over the country or it'll be introduced slowly and behind the curtains.\n\nIn the first case, we'll face some instability in the near future, but the second option will make us look weak in front of the resistance."
area11.1.a:0 "Introduce Them Step By Step"
area11.1.b:0 "Pull Them Quickly!"

area11.2.t:0 "Old Gods, New Masters"
area11.2.d:0 "Although Britannia has imposed her mighty rule over Japan, the daily reports are showing a certain opposition to the embracement Britannian values and culture. For this reason we must confine and liquidate all signs of the decadent Japanese tradition, including all religious aspects. Since the recent administrative division of the country, the army has discovered many Shintoist monuments, temples and traditional buildings, especially in the countryside.\n\nFor Viceroy Bismark, the solution is simple and fair: the systematic destruction of every trace of this nonsense. In this way, we'll clear out various zone to re-use for Britannian structures and, most important of all, a major point of Japanese identity is going to vanish forever. The operation will be carried out along the normal anti-insurgency expeditions, to maximize the efficiency of the project."
area11.2.a:0 "Tear Down Those Temples!"

area11.3.t:0 "Struggles Within The SRA"
area11.3.d:0 "After the recent consolidation of our administrative hold over Area 11, it seems that various elements within the rival factions of the SRA are trying to gain more influence and power. In particular, the Purist Faction has been conducting hidden sabotages to our reforms in the last months, considered to be too "gentle" for the Elevens. Furthermore, many nobles have already expressed their desire to move to the newly planned settlements, and they WILL have a considerable political weight.\n\nLuckily, Bismark has been strengthening his grip over the SRA as well, and the Iron Viceroy is not going to tolerate any direct or indirect confrontation to his authority. In fact, he revealed his intention to use the Secret Services and loyal Generals to keep in track certain individuals and make sure that his projects will proceed without "interruptions""
area11.3.a:0 "Bismark Rule Is Absolute."

area11.4.t:0 "Complete Eradication"
area11.4.d:0 "After the first phase of De-Japanization, that took interest mainly in material structures and symbols, time has finally come to hit the very core of old society and tradition. In particular, all religious-Shintoist writings, along its vocal expression in public places and houses, will be severely banned and rituals of any ideology or faith will be punished with forced labor. Furthermore, any allegiance to the old flag or Kururugi will mean instant deportation to the New Anglia penal colony or the hell of Area 7.\n\nAfter all, all aspects linked to traditional dresses, dates, cultural festivals and, especially; decadent habits and behaviour will disappear one way or another. One suppression past another, we will be able to reduce future instablity and confuse the public and the resistance. Indeed, it's our duty to educate Elevens of their place in our superior culture and embrace the mighty Imperial teachings, following the doctrine of Saint Charles Darwin and Social Darwinism."
area11.4.a:0 "Piece by Piece, The Whole Structure Will Crash Down..."

area11.5.t:0 "Opening Of Tokyo Settlement"
area11.5.d:0 "Many journalists from all over the world were called to see the construction site of the brand new Tokyo Settlement, which would have been reserved only for high-ranking nobles and the government. Bismark was proud to show the colossal building to the public, who was, for the most part, astonished by the palace's height. Only the European press seemed to be scared of the site, contemplating this to be a possible future of Paris or Sankt Petersburg - Considering the recent tensions in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfter the initial introduction, the so-called Iron Viceroy claimed that this was the symbol of Britannia's hegamony over the islands for the following decades to come. Furthermore, he invited the whole world to stop referring to the area as "Japan", as in that moment they had its official funeral; obviously, this was instantly followed by numerous laughs from the public.\n\nSome time after the ceremony, as Bismark retired to the SRA's provisional center, some officers informed him of an avoided terrorist bombing earlier planned by the resistance in the site. He loudly cursed, and quickly relayed to his staff: "We must commence that damn Operation Sunset as soon as possible!""
area11.5.a:0 "Britannian Architecture Is The Best!"

area11.6.t:0 "Economic Report No.72"
area11.6.d:0 "Before activating the financial relief plan, the Viceroy has issued an urgent report to verify the state of Japanese industry after the Pacific War, and the results are, to say at least, worrying. Virtually all light industry has been crippled following the general chaos caused by Kururugi's death. Furthermore, a good part of heavy industry, which was limited in scale to begin with, has been completely destroyed by our Knightmares. The Sakuradite mines, the main reason of the conflict, are mostly intact, but nearly fifty percent is in the resistance's hand or controlled by the powerful Kirihara remnants. Our specialists have admitted that the difficult geographical location of the mines have severly impacted our efficiency and, as a result of this, they can't be properly exploited.\n\nIn order to relieve the situation, many experts have advised a strong collaboration with Britannian conglomerates, which will deploy mercenary troops from China. This will surely be costly, but it's the option favoured by the aristocracy and the Purist faction.On the other hand, Bismark is more keen on a strategic alliance with the Kyoto House, which will provoke a quick economic relief and has a deep knowledge of the territory. Obviously, this will be hidden from the eyes of the Knights of Round and Britannian press, although the Emperor has allowed us a certain range of maneuver."
area11.6.a:0 "Elevens cannot be trusted."
area11.6.b:0 "Bismark's orders, we obey."

area11.7.t:0 "Meeting At Fuji"
area11.7.d:0 "It was about midnight, and Bismark was travelling with some guards near the old Fuji mine; the place of the meeting was proposed by the Kyoto House, as it was one of the least visited zones in Japan after the great chaos. Everything was according to the plan of the Viceroy, as the old Japanese corporations were ready to negotiate an informal truce and technically submit to the Britannian authority, guaranteeing the functionality of the immense Sakuradite's extraction sites all over Area 11.\n\nThe secret deal further included a general amnesty to all components of Kyoto House, who will actively collaborate to the reconstruction and will temporary cease all support to the Cliques' resistance. In particular, Kirihara, the previous economic minister of Japan, was sent as a representative of all industrial groups, to talk with Bismark, who seemed more than happy to break the main base of the annoying sabotages. Obviously, at least for the initial period, the deal will be shared only with the most trusted officials and the opposition won't be able to exploit this episode."
area11.7.a:0 "This Must Not Leave The Area, You Hear Me?"


area11.8.t:0 "A Chat With Odysseus"
area11.8.d:0 "Bismark was preparing to receive Prime Minister Odysseus in the new Tokyo Settlement; although the Prince was officially here for holiday purposes, he would use the occasion to listen to the Viceroy's economic demands, too. In particular, Bismark had already petitioned a request for extremely-low interest loans from the major Britannian conglomerates, but since these were controlled by the hostile great Britannian families, only the permission of a royal prince could have unlocked the situation.\n\nOdysseus was tired as always, with his same shenanigans of general boredom and neglect, just as the last time the two men met several years ago in Pendragon for family matters. Bismark was already preparing his rhetoric skills to convince the Prince, but he was stunned after Odysseus yawned, casually claiming:\n\n"I can give you whatever loan you want, Knight Of One. As long as I don't have to visit those ruins..."\n\nThe Iron Viceroy thought it'd be easy, but not THAT easy."
area11.8.a:0 "Heh, saves me the speech.


area11.9.t:0 "The Underground Economy"
area11.9.d:0 "A radical economic reconstruction couldn't be possible without the suppression of the underground economy, present in the Area since the first years after the Pacific War. Although it has saved numerous civilians from a total deprivation of fundamental goods, such as food, clothes or tools, it has been widely exploited in these months by the Cliques, in order to gather armaments and guns from both the Area or China.\n\nFurthermore, it is increasingly becoming a problem for the SRA and the corporations, since a giant black market has emerged as a hub for illegal trade, empowering Yakuza and local corrupted officers beyond previously imaginable levels. Bismark has therefore concluded that only a violent suppression, using military forces and loyal spies to pin-point the major illegal networks or other operations; would permanently decapitate this sewer of degeneracy. There will be no ground nor rest to the enemies of Britannia."
area11.9.a:0 "Bust. Burn. Repeat."

area11.10.t:0 "The Social Ladder"
area11.10.d:0 "According to the principles of our ideology, Social-Darwinism, we will radically reorganise the society of Area 11 and its labor market. In particular, a rigid societal hierarchy will be established and it will resemble the structure of the other Areas'. The Nobles and the Aristocrats will be positioned in the upper class, although the top of the pyramid will always be occupied by the Emperor - With the royal family, and the Knights of Rounds. Furthermore; middle and low ranking officers, the bureaucracy, and organized-crime will be placed in the middle class.\n\nEventually, the lower class will be composed by ordinary Britannian citizens and below: the Honorary Britannians(Elevens who decided to serve in the Britannian Army in exchange for minimal human rights), and regular Elevens at the bottom."
area11.10.a:0 "Inequality Is Strength!"

area11.11.t:0 "Modifying The Landscape"
area11.11.d:0 "Viceroy Bismark has just announced to the mainland his intention, in front of the SRA, to implement Project Borehole during this month. Project Borehole was a recent plan designed by various economists and engineers at the direct orders of Bismark, several months after the Second Pacific War, and it provided information about the construction of the greatest mine the world has ever seen. Furthermore, it assured immense profit with maximun efficiency standards, although it will require a great deal of energy and extensive manpower. Luckily, the Geass Order has located the massive reserve of Sakuradite behind Mount Fuji which was deemed as the ideal location to build the structure.\n\nIt is estimated that the landscape will be severely damaged, but it's an acceptable sacrifice for the Empire of Britannia; indeed, we won't make the same errors of Kururugi and sabotage our minerary industry for a dead concept of nationality of a pathetic people."
area11.11.a:0 "The Sakuradite Must Flow!"

area11.12.t:0 "Taking Down The Legacy"
area11.12.d:0 "Despite Kirihara's departure into an unknown hideout and the collapse of his industries, it seems that the other members of the Kyoto House are still trying to play the clock, taking precious time to decide their every move, under the banner of Kaguya Sumeragi; a young woman who intelligence's reports claim her recent nomination as Kyoto house's head mistress. The SRA, against Bismark's advice, has decided to issue a series of mandates to take down the remaining representatives of the old Japanese legacy.\n\nIn precedence, the Laws of Dissolution hit only Kirihara, since they were aimed at taking direct control of Sakuradite refineries. We understimated the tenacity of the remaining members of the Kyoto group. We expect that, with the last provisions, their economic activity that happens to be directly linked to the support for the resistance, will become drastically marginalized. Along with any remaining legacy of Kururugi"
area11.12.a:0 "Too Merciful?"


area11.13.t:0 "New Office Of Human Resources"
area11.13.d:0 "New directives from the SRA has ordered the division of Elevens into two groups: the first will join as cannon fodder in the garrison's brigades, while the rest will be put to work in special "relief" zones, including many slaves from South America. These camps will be established to hasten economic recovery, with the reconstruction of many industrial parks and Sakuradite refineries.\n\nThe administrative part, instead; will be controlled by the economic branch of the SRA, excluding Bismark's group, in close ties with the corporations. Through this, the process is going to require considerable efforts and intensified pacification of the public, since many reports indicated riots in the major camps.\n\nThis is precisely why we have a military garrison. We are not here for their interests, but to ours.\n\nThankfully, the latest modules of the Police's Knightframes come with adequate whips."
area11.13.a:0 "Idle hands are tools for the devil."

area11.14.t:0 "Tokyo Declaration"
area11.14.d:0 "Near midnight, Bismark was seen heading towards the Fuji Mount, and was immediately blocked by guards loyal to the SRA, whilst Kirihara was seen in the same area by our spies. The connection was clear; and so were the intentions of Bismark, who was forced to give into our demands. In the following days, he agreed to break any deal with the Kyoto House and make a joint declaration, in the Tokyo Settlment, condemning the old Japanese government and its industries.\n\nWith this step, we have assured the continuation of the standard Britannian economic politics, and the predominance of the pure Britannian conglomerates, which will operate in the territory without any further restriction. This victory will strengthen the position of radical factions within the SRA, purists and nobles in head."

area11.16.t:0 "The Art of Guerilla"
area11.16.d:0 "After months of reconnaissance and the disappearance of many search parties and heavy equipment, we have managed to complete the mapping of several major rebel activities across the new area. This was ordered directly by Bismark - And had brought us closer to the final end of this insurgency.\n\nIn particular, we have verified that each major rebel group is not collaborating with any another and in fact appear uncapable of uniting their efforts. This represents a great advantage to us, since they don't have enough offensive power to seriously threaten our grip in major urban cities or supply points individually.\n\nThese groups can be considered as separate Cliques; with many remnants of the old Japanese army. Soldiers in whatever divisions that survived are still being commanded by their officers and the command structure is only divided at the level of Senior Generals. At times, we have confirmed internal clashes among these groups, which can be exploited to weaken their positions."
area11.16.a:0 "Divided, each by his sorrow, all to the same fate."

area11.17.t:0 "The Tiger In The North"
area11.17.d:0 "Several investigations and information gathering efforts have resulted in a more detailed map of all insurgency groups.\n\nIn the center, ex-General Josui Kusakabe is leading the largest militia group in the country; in addition, he has a vast reserve of equipment, especially light arms and vehicles, located in secret warehouses in the ruins of Tokyo and its surroundings. The General has proven himself to be short-tempered and impulsive, which severely minimalizes his effectiveness in battle.\n\nIn the south, another ex-General, named Katase, is establishing his base somewhere around the Kyushu region, with several forts built in the mountainous territories. He lacks serious attack capabilities but has a formidable defensive position.\n\nThe last, and by far the most dangerous, is Tohdoh. The one responsible of several victories against our Knightmares. He has by far the most military experience, and he is the most sensible tactician of Kururugi's army. He uses Hit-And-Run strategies, a real thorn in the side of our troops."
area11.17.a:0 "That Damned Lieutenant..."

area11.15.t:0 "Passing The Torch"
area11.15.d:0 "After several years of service, Bismark was ready to dismiss himself from the absolute ruler of Area 11 and dissolve the Supreme Reconstruction Authority; he was too tired to carry on another decade in this mess. Despite this, he wasn't so eager to let his work be ruined by some arrogant Britannian aristocratic of a Governor. For this reason, he had decided on the institution of a local Senate, which would have been filled with his supporters and advisors.\n\nAfter all, the situation in Area 11 was delicate and it had to be competently managed in order to maintain the stability they had achieved. Many collaborators begged him to remain in his place, but the Emperor had greater plans for him in battlefields, rather than bureaucratic offices."
area11.15.a:0 "Bismark, you're an honor to the homelands."


area11.18.t:0 "PenNIIOKhT Substance No. 33"
area11.18.d:0 "Conventional tacticts are proving to be overall ineffective in most anti-terrorism operations, and Knightmare production is still in an inefficent stage to cover all of the islands simultaneously.\n\nLuckily for us, Pendragon Research Institute has offered us a powerful nervine agent; Possibly the most powerful ever developed in Britannian territory. Using this substance, codename "PenNIIOKhT substance No. 33", we will be able to catch and neutralize entire groups in a more efficient way, with drastically lower casualty rates to our ranks. It's important to consider that this actions will effect the civilian population as well, under the potential of the insurgents hiding within crowds."
area11.18.a:0 "Prepare the gas..."


area11.19.t:0 "Bismark's Special Operation"
area11.19.d:0 "Supreme Commander Bismark has decided that the time has come to strike a major blow to the Japanese resistance. This plan was carefully put together by Bismark himself and his closest advisors.\n\nThe major objective will be Kusakabe in the center, where our elite troops will be deployed to eliminate most of warehouses (discovered by our Secret Services) and fool Japanese soldiers. We will make them believe that we will be retreating to more secure positions, near Sakuradite mines, and as they approach - A double vanguard of Knightmares will do the job.\n\nIn the south, specialized Knightmares will take care of several defensive strongholds located around the mountain ranges, forcing Katase to flee into deeper positions, far from our supply posts.\n\nEventually, Tohdoh will be faced by Bismark's personal soldiers, with the help of Attack Helicopters and Long-Range Artillery, in this way,the superior firepower will stop Tohdoh from helping the other Cliques. After his operation, they will stay quiet and lick their wounds."
area11.19.a:0 "This Should Keep Them At Bay For A While."

area11.20.t:0 "A New Britannian Dawn"
area11.20.d:0 "Clovis' arrival to Area 11 had been one of parades.\n\nAn extravagant march of loud-booted infantry under several squadrons of Britannian next-generation aircraft rocked the Tokyo Settlement on the dawn of his Highness' arrival.\n\nStanding high atop his Land Cruiser, the Viceroy gave an awe-striking speech; Promising any of those still opposing Britannia "complete annihilation". Furthermore, a few noblewomen were spotted laughing and drinking at the back of the Cruiser, cheering for their Prince as he stepped down.\n\nA vanguard of Knightmares were on full display as they surrounded his escort, standing as a painful reminder to any of those that still had any internal association to the old flag of honorary Britannians and Elevens alike. More so to those of them that actively participated in the insurgency, whom by now have started to become tired - helplessly watching as their collar was passed to a new master."
area11.20.a:0 "All Hail the Viceroy!\nAll Hail Britannia!"

area11.21.t:0 "Area 12"
area11.21.d:0 ""Sir. Yessir!"\n\nThe sun had barely rose over the Korean peninsula, yet the sky was filled with Britannian aircraft of all shapes. The scene shifts to focus on one massive Britannian aerial carrier; As Knightmares leap out of it and onto defenseless Chinese armored vehicles, depicting the most recently developed modules leaked by Britannian intelligence.\n\nStarring Clovis La Britannia in a Knightmare of gold and crimson, the movie "Area 12" had been commissioned and directed by the Viceroy: In which Honorary Britannians are displayed in a state of complete subservience to their pure-blooded masters, with Britannian forces using Area 11 as a staging ground for an invasion of the Korean peninsula and Manchukuo, carving out Area 12.\n\nThe movie, so far, had smashed box offices worldwide and many Chinese producers have promised retaliation. Furthermore, the Chinese Federation had banned the movie within its territories and sent a strongly-worded letter to the Holy Britannian Empire, requesting a formal apology. The Emperor ignored the letter."
area11.21.a:0 "What do you mean by "sold out"?!"

area11.22.t:0 "Lazy Afternoons"
area11.22.d:0 "There was a serene breeze, as sergeant Lars led the three IFVs under his command through the narrow, thick forest path for the 7th time this month. Since the new Viceroy's assignment, he hadn't seen anything other than this strip of 37 kilometers and his personnel's faces.\n\nBack in Bismark's reign, he was just a corporal. But that bastard would have him patrol every traversable inch these islands had to offer, and combat was a weekly occurrence. Now, he thought - They were just wasting fuel. It wasn't like an insurgent squad would just spawn to the side of the road. And even if it did, they won't be able to chase them in this terrain. Headquarter's commands had been... "Strange". As if recent orders have been blind to previous casualties we've endured to date.\n\nInterrupting his train of thoughts like a roar of thunder; a sound that couldn't be comprehended without thinking that the front vehicle had driven over an improvised land-mine brought the whole patrol to a halt, and took Lar's heart straight back to Pendragon, to his beloved Lena.\n\nScrambling to climb over the hatch for a direly-needed view and ordering the rear vehicle to make a 180° turn, a well-placed sniper was all the insurgents needed now."
area11.22.a:0 "A Noble's resort nearby?! I said we need the gas, NOW."

area11.23.t:0 "A Strongly-Worded Letter"
area11.23.d:0 "§ROFFICE OF ROYAL AFFAIRS§!\n§RTO: VICEROY CLOVIS LA BRITANNIA§!\n§RFROM: CHIEF OF STAFF BISMARK WALDSTEIN\n\n\n"Clovis. It is with utter abhorrence that I write you this.\n\nSince your appointment, you have delegated or delayed every critical decision the ministers have presented to you with careless heedlessness. Chasing every skirt in the settlement, letting the insurgency re-emerge, and crippling the administration would have had you now against a firing squad if not for your royal ties.\n\nTurning a blind eye to your incompetence risks throwing the entire Area to flames. If this goes on, §RI will have an audience with the Emperor and authoraize a dishonorable discharge of your position as Viceroy.§! You better man-up and fix this mess.""
area11.23.a:0 "That arrogant fool! He wouldn't dare!"

area11.24.t:0 "A Hands-free Approach?"
area11.24.d:0 "The clock struck once, with all "guests" arriving on the minute.\n\nThey were all well-informed of how secretive this meeting was supposed to be, and how this SRA-mimicking body was going to operate. 18 officials, inclusive of the co-managers; were authorized to completely take over the Viceroy's responsiblities and actively manage every aspect of Area 11 atop their current duties, effectively making the Viceroyality a figurehead's title while retaining the Prince's authority to alter course at any time.\n\nNone opposed their undeclared promotions, with most welcoming the creation of the Royal Administrative Oversight. As far as Clovis was concerned, that name would mean exactly what it sounds as to Britannian press."
area11.24.a:0 "And if Bismark hears of this..."

area11.25.t:0 "The First Assembly"
area11.25.d:0 "The first few hours were a complete mess.\n\nThe largest conference rooms could seem tiny when they're filled to the brim with an array of staff, each yelling at their assigned clerks to arrange their share of paperwork by "priority", or whatever that meant in the instance. The freight that came from Clovis' office to cluster the doorway every twenty minutes didn't ease anyone's nerves.\n\nBismark's obsession with micromanagement only came to light after diving into the more miniscule affairs that some of these documents covered, unveiling the mystery behind his early resignation. Every Knightmare's post-combat damage assessments, the cashflow of every Noble family within the settlement, and every request of establishing a new enterprise within the region would turn anyone's hair white.\n\nAt the end of the day, the only decision that the Oversight's board were able to unanimously agree on was that the bureaucracy needed a complete overhaul, but that could wait. What mattered now is that the goverment had started to wake up, and each of these men could pursue their own agendas."
area11.25.a:0 "Ha, to think the Viceroy would last an hour here."

area11.26.t:0 "Another day in Tokyo"
area11.26.d:0 "It first seemed that the six-hour meetings would not last over a month or two, but now - Everyone within the RAO is getting tired. The shouting, insults, and infidelity accusations have become all but common. And the Area's problems don't seem to be coming to an end anytime soon.\n\nContrary to what some within the Royal Administrive Oversight had originally anticipated, of various ministers forming cliques to milk the Viceroyality of its assets; the decenteralization of authority have created an interdepartmental rivalry that would see political figures forwarding agendas that would defund their opponents, being more divided than to exploit their positions. Thanks to Hadleigh and Asprius' influence, the worst of these ploys have been avoided, yet this by no means entails that the area will be any less of a mess than it already is.\n\nThe local administration must come to fulfill a recently issued list of objectives and annual plans before applying to receive the generous subsidies granted to developing areas within the Empire. Until then, Britannization programs and infrastructure projects must continue."
area11.26.a:0 "Be honest, is my hair turning white?"

area11.28.d:0 "Grave news have reached our intelligence.\n\nFor as long as we've been safeguarding Britannian interests throughout Area 11, every act of resistence against our forces had been divided. But now, this doesn't seem to be the case any further.\n\nIn response to increased Britannization amongst Elevens, the cliques, led by Katase Tatewaki; have issued a formal declaration that the Japanese sun's resurgance is as imminent as "the next Britannian atrocity".\n\nGossip is spreading like wildfire throughout the ghettos of this front. And the number of Elevens applying to become honorary Britannians have come to a grinding halt. Everywhere throughout the islands, everyone is speculating with hastening breaths what the future holds for Area 11."

area11.29.d:0 "The hour was 3:14 past midnight, yet the Code R team only truly thrived at night.\n\nAt the center of the facility was general Asprius, diligent as always: Facing a monitor of a magnificent scale. With hundreds of images of suspected individuals being passed through it by the minute. All around him were researchers and off-book detectives scouring documents of dates going back to the invasion's first landing in hopes of finding any trace.\n\nThey were all searching for the same features that all odd casuality reports hinted towards; A feminine, mostly-slim figure. Hazel, dead eyes. And most notably - Long, verdant hair. Whom these characteristics, grouped together, earned the nickname "Green witch".\n\nUnspoken desperation was crushing down on the team's initial enthusiasm, before everyone's search was brought to an instantaneous halt with a shout of "HOLD" by the general. Ordering the screen operator to go back exactly four images, and bingo. A stray photo taken by a Britannian security camera displays the "witch" openly walking in a lowly clerk's outfit within the settlement just a few hours ago. Without wasting a moment, the general called his best team."

Having to hear her soothing, warm yet exhausted voice over the past two months throughout interexperiment breaks might have charmed him too greatly. His attitude with the researchers had shifted from proactive encouragement to silent scorn, being the one to feed her by his own hand seems to have ticked something within both of them.\n\nAlex thought to himself one last time.\nWas he genuinely about to betray his general and shame his family for the sake of this girl? Whom he not so long ago would not have hesitated to liquidate on the spot? Was he... under the charm of a spell?\n\nThe captain shook his head and closed his eyes. He was on a mission to secure her transportation to an even safer facility, and that would've been the last he'd see her. That meant this minute was his last chance of escaping with her.\n\n"Driver, take that alley. Get to the docks."\nWas he doing it? His heart never struck faster. His eyes flew off to meet the witch's, to earn a weakly yet heavenly smile in return. Rewarding his endeavor with a moment of bliss, before the distance the transport had traveled away from its escorts grew enough for it to be rammed by a tractor.\n\nFor ten or so seconds, everything was blank. But every detail of how insurgents flooded the transport and massacared his men was vivid. His head bled hard from the hit he took, and that might've been enough to convince the resistence's members of his fatality. With his weapon nowhere in arm's reach, he could only helplessly watch as his dearest was taken away and loaded up in an empty gas capsule at the back of what seemed to be a commercial-issue truck."

Our police force's response wasn't fast enough to prevent the accident, as the perpetrators infiltrated Britannian districts from the Elevens' ghettos. The situation is further worsened by the lack of O.S.I. agents who majorly left when Bismark did.\n\nFew people were killed, and material damages are mostly manageable. Luckily, the Fuji mines and other extraction sites were spared, thanks to their tightened security. However, the greatest loss today was the destruction of our myth of invincibility."

Considering his theatrical skills, there's no doubt that he will succeed in his task.

They will be initially confined to specific zones within Area 11 to speculate how honoraries would react. Several ghettos near major Britannian Settlements will be the first targets.\n\nClovis is hoping to salvage the Green Witch Project, as the Code R research team have reported stolen material, documents and experimental assets from their base near Shinjuku, this to be linked to cells of local terrorists.\n\nThese operations will be also directed from Clovis in person, much to the disapproval of local Generals."

Knightmares will then level down the streets with their extraordinary firepower.\n\nConsidering our numerical superiority, it won't be necessary to call in reinforcements or a carefully planned strategy.

Despite this, we can sustain any limited losses due to our sheer numbers.\n\nWe do not seek their surrender, but their extermination. Our Knightmares will bulldoze everything down.

But now our entire platoon had been obliterated by a complete collapse of the metropolitan subways just below our center. Just as his highness' command centre fell in imminent danger, Earl Lloyd authoraized the Lancelot to take off, and so it did  with a blast.\n\nPrivate Suzaku Kururgi was able to wreck havoc on the enemies' Sutherlands. In a flurry of dancing flames, he went on relentlessly smashing and ripping apart the heads of enemy knightmares, outgunning the entire terrorist force and easily deflecting their bullets whenever encircled.\n\nIn a final waltz, private Suzaku come to a close confrontation with the enemy's commander and nearly decapitated the snake's head - Yet he had let the opportunity slip to rescue the useless lives of two Elevens!

One source claims a stray shot was heard coming from the Command Center.\n\nThe moment we sent soldiers to investigate was far too late. With Clovis' corpse laying on the floor in a puddle of blood. The perpetrator of this assassination had already escaped, and only a Britannian-issued pistol and body armor were present in the scene.

A11_bismark:0 "Time To Call Bismark"
A11_bismark_desc:0 "It seems the situation in the new Area is more complex than we thought, considering the general chaos that followed our swift conquest. There are few men in the Empire that can assume the delicate role of rebuilding a destroyed nation, and one of them is the Knight of One; Bismark Waldstein. Soon he will assume the title of official Viceroy, with wide powers inside the Britannian administration."

This has enabled us to resolve some of most urgent issues by "illegal" means - But it had equally enabled the head of every department to write any arbitary request to the government and stamp its approval without any necessary authorization."
A11_tolerate_purists:0 "Tolerate Purist Presence"
A11_tolerate_purists_desc:0 "Since Clovis' assignment, the Officer corps have steadily grown in tenacity. Of course, this only spells woe to the enemies of the Empire. However, razing tens of thousands of square kilometers of forests or gassing entire districts to neutralize groups of insurgents that don't surpass the number of fingers on a hand is drastically reducing the viable biosphere we could build further settlements within."
A11_organised_crime:0 "Blind Eye On Crime"
A11_organised_crime_desc:0 "With a growing administrative strain on the goverment, all of its sectors are starting to crack. This is especially the case for local police departments. There have been rumors of bribery within officers' ranks and agreements with major crimelords and Yakuza remnants. The most extreme of which claim that human trafficking is emerging within the ghettos... What's the dignity of an Eleven, anyway?"
A11_partying:0 "Drinks and Parties!"
A11_partying_desc:0 "At last - His Highness can finally enjoy the sweet, sweet fruits of his hard work. Almost as sweet as his last affair with a dazzling youngwoman from Ashford... No longer is he bothered with mundane affairs. The Viceroyalty is an honorary title of prestige and glory. And as such, the wine shall flow!"
A11_pen_message:0 "A Message From Pendragon"
A11_pen_message_desc:0 "We have received an unusual letter from home. Every letter that came into office since the new administration had either been directed at the Viceroy bearing a Noblewoman's insignia, or had a clear title designated for state administration. This one was signed by Bismark - The Knight of One, and is classified from every eye below that of the Viceroy's."
A11_clovis_decision:0 "Clovis' Decision"
A11_clovis_decision_desc:0 "As irritating a return to office would be, Viceroy Clovis cannot risk Bismark tarnishing his reputation.His Highness concluded that the perfect course of action is forming an executive body. Composing it of the ministers, chief bureaucrats and top generals would resolve worst problems. To avoid indecision, it will be under co-management of Minister Hadleigh and General Aspirius."
A11_tokyo_bombings:0 "Tokyo Bombings"
A11_tokyo_bombings_desc:0 "The newly proclaimed Japanese Liberation Front has shown that Britannian Settlements, even after Bismark's massive repression, are not yet completely safe. It is a great hit to our internal position, and it needs to be addressed quickly."
A11_organise:0 "Re-Start Cleaning Campaigns"
A11_organise_desc:0 "Viceroy Clovis has surprisingly remained calm after the events and he has ordered a robust military action in major ghettos near the settlements. These massacres will be presented as anti-terrorism operations to ensure the favor of Britannians and international public opinion."
A11_ghetto_battle_1:0 "Battle Of Yokohama"
A11_ghetto_battle_1_desc:0 "The first target is Yokohama, near the Tokyo Settlement. Honorary Britannians will in be deployed and act in actuality as cannon fodder to any potential resistence. Knightmares will intervene as necessary."
A11_ghetto_battle_2:0 "Battle of Hinohara"
A11_ghetto_battle_2_desc:0 "The second target will be Hinohara, which had appeared, contrary to our expectations, much more fortified than the previous ghetto. Although the situation might be trickier, we will simply encircle and eradicate any fortified position we encounter."
A11_ghetto_battle_3:0 "Battle of Shinjuku"
A11_ghetto_battle_3_desc:0 "Shinjuku is the third target of our campaign, and it is also the place where the green witch is expected to be located. It is fundamental to succeed in this operation. Although Knightmare losses are way too high, the enemy is concentrated only in the centre of the ghetto. A charge of everything - including the squadrons guarding the Viceroy - will win the day!"
A11_clovis_death:0 "Endgame"
A11_clovis_death_desc:0 "We have fully eradicated opposition within the Shinjuku ghetto, albeit at an extremely high cost of men and material. Remaining forces will conduct search-and-destroy sorties of anything still breathing under these ruins."
A11_diarchy:0 "A Necessary Diarchy"
A11_diarchy_desc:0 "This Viceroyalty had been a calamity on the goverment. And the time had come to do something about the growing unrest both within and outside of the settlement. General Asprius had ordered bi-weekly 6-hour meetings until the despair that is of all of Clovis' paperwork would be conquered. And to make matters worse; Hadleigh requested a review of every approved project within the last four months."
A11_war_minister:0 "Asprius' Ambitions"
A11_war_minister_desc:0 "It's well-known to Clovis that Asprius' interests lies with what his Highness views as a cabal of esoteric lunatics, allowing the Viceroy to not bother entertaining the probablity of a coup. The General's competency in handling the RAO and his now near-limitless authority had finally given him the necessary freedom of initiative in pursuing the group's interests."
A11_interior_minister:0 "Hadleigh's Proposals"
A11_interior_minister_desc:0 "Through a series of programs that aim to expand the settlement, establish a tourist sector for the upper echelons and improve quality of life for the nobles - Hadleigh believes that this will attract far more lucrative investments and begin a gold-rush for the industrialization of Area 11."
A11_leisure_place:0 "A Place For Leisures..."
A11_leisure_place_desc:0 "A large portion of the outskirts of the Tokyo settlement will need to be dedicated as part of the development program. A series of facilities within the location have already surpassed the planning phase. At the head of list is the "Tower of Babel"; a projected massive tower serving as a vertical "pleasure district" of its own with everything from casinos and lavish restaurants to theaters."
A11_duties_2:0 "...And Duties"
A11_duties_2_desc:0 "To foster growth of the private sector, families wishing to extend their stay beyond limited tourism within Area 11 will require either establishing firms to employ the growing number of honorary Britannians or make massive investments into the local stock exchanges. This way; we will bloat the reputation of Area 11 as a home to the elite of the elite."
A11_promote_culture:0 "Promote Britannian Culture"
A11_promote_culture_desc:0 "As per imperial code of conduct, every new building constructed on the Area's soil must stand as a monument of Britannian supremacy.

A11_housing:0 "New Housing Programs"
A11_housing_desc:0 "For the sake of our continuous rule on the Area 11, we will need to integrate a strong class composed of the local officers, incoming personnel, and the lower casts of nobility by giving them affordable yet accommodating housing, which is currently in severe scarcity relative to demand. The new developing zone will be dominated by districts for residential use."
A11_new_universities:0 "Establish An Educational District"
A11_new_universities_desc:0 "A dangerous issue becomes more apparent; Existing educational centers are painfully inadequate. A series of public schools will be the cornerstone of the developing zone to ease the pressure on currently operating institutes. Moreover, the Ashford Foundation's initiative of establishing the first private academy had been well-received."
A11_art_contests:0 "Promote Art Contests"
A11_art_contests_desc:0 "The romanticization of Britannian culture is what makes it the best in the world. By issuing expansive grants to prestigous artists from the core of the Empire to participate in local art exhibitions, we can paint a subtle image to the crowds; of Britannia stretching out its hand to the Elevens."
A11_slow_ethnic_cleansing:0 "Slow Down Cultural Cleansing"
A11_slow_ethnic_cleansing_desc:0 "The rate at which Elevens sign up to become honorary Britannians had hiked far beyond our current capabilities of taking every single individual through the rigid loyalty routines. As a momentary measure, we will abolish the most demanding of these tests. High command deems the past of Elevens to be of no further relevance."
A11_remove_martial_law:0 "Demilitarize Remote Regions"
A11_remove_martial_law_desc:0 "The insurgency may be a shadow of the force Bismark faced a few years back, but some chokepoints, mostly of remnants of the Tohdoh clique, have re-emerged. As unpopular as this may sound, but our force is spread thin as it is - We have to momentarily abandon a few insignificant pockets to better concentrate our efforts inland, and give the most exhausted of our troops a breather."
A11_abolish_mil_regions:0 "The New Normal"
A11_abolish_mil_regions_desc:0 "Perhaps motivated by our new patrol routes that don't seem as bold as they used to be, elements within the old cliques have seen a resurging activity. As if they are a cancer that keeps appearing whenever you extirpate its core. No bother. We will abandon the remote regions completely and focus on eradicating any fighting spirit that remains within the larger population."
A11_minor_crackdowns:0 "Continue Minor Crackdowns"
A11_minor_crackdowns_desc:0 "The ghettos have gone unscathed for too long. Such leniency has no place in Area 11. We will organize surprise searches and arbitary executions through every gathering of Elevens under our heels. They must be reminded that their place, if not in our labor camps - Lies in the ash."
A11_honorary_brt:0 "Expand Honorary Britannians"
A11_honorary_brt_desc:0 "For as long as we've began accepting Elevens, the honorary Britannians have acted as nothing more than cannon fodder in our army. Only given serious weaponary to assualt the heaviest of enemy entrenchments. Honoraries that fully prove themselves in loyalty and ability will be granted room to act within our military as Privates, with a very limited yet open possiblity of promotion."
A11_native_navy:0 "A Proper Navy"
A11_native_navy_desc:0 "It had been disclosed by Code R that an offshore island maintains an indispensable site to the team's research.\n\nTight security measures will be necessary, commissioning a formidable navy will provide due protection and divert unwanted attention."
A11_geass_reserch:0 "Begin Geass Researches"
A11_geass_reserch_desc:0 "After years of being nothing more than an office of hypothetical analytics, the Code R research team had been officially established as an underground department under the Viceroy's palace. After some "accidents" and the liquidation of the honoraries that did much of the gruesome labor to enact the facility, very few know of the department's existence beyond the scientists in place."
A11_project_green_witch:0 "Project Green Witch I"
A11_project_green_witch_desc:0 "The pinnacle of our research and cooperation with the Geass cult had enlightened our experts of an entity powerful enough to sustain experimentation and take us closer to our ultimate objective. Rumors within the cult suggest that this being is who the O.S.I. had been on the trail of throughout Area 11. If that is true, then it's a race. And we cannot afford to lose."
A11_project_green_witch_2:0 "Project Green Witch II"
A11_project_green_witch_2_desc:0 "We have pinpointed the location of the entity. Our top directors have prepared all manners of exhilirating experiments to extract what we need of her tender flesh."
A11_geass_cult:0 "Collaborate With The Cult"
A11_geass_cult_desc:0 "In the span of a few weeks, intensified sakuradite studies have revealed invaluable insights to our team that'd otherwise have required years of hypothesies and inefficient calculations. But it's not nearly enough if we wish to achieve our goals within the decade. Collaboration with the Geass cult will be all that is needed to realize our vision."
A11_rebuild_army:0 "Reinforce The Garrison Army"
A11_rebuild_army_desc:0 "The past few months have been a disaster for the local garrison, with casualties coming close to that of the first occupation's years. We will formally request new officers from the homelands and anti-insurgency specialists from the archipelago of Area 10 to bring the Elevens back under our heels."
A11_no_restrictions:0 "Knightmare Restrictions No More!"
A11_no_restrictions_desc:0 "The results of untold lobbying and bribery back home with the military's chief legislators and industrial conglomerates have finally allowed our local brigades to acquire advanced Knightmare modules. The only concerns were widespread fears among the Britannian royal family and the officer corps alike that members of the resistence would get their hands on these modules, but that's unthinkable."
A11_knight_police:0 "Integrate Knight Police"
A11_knight_police_desc:0 "If our garrison had learned anything from this resources' sink of an occupation, it's that when you invade a nation with Knightmares: You should maintain order using the same knightmares. The vast majority of Knightmares left Area 11 when combat mostly came to an end. As fatal of a mistake that had been, the time to make up for it is now."
A11_funds:0 "More Funds"
A11_funds_desc:0 "As great as knightmares may be, they are still in a stage where they're inefficient and extremely costly if we're to require their sole presence on every square kilometer. Our infantry remains an integral force of the garrision, their equipment must see a direly needed overhaul and a severely delayed upgrade of heavy armaments must take place."
A11_secret_bases:0 "Secret Bases For Secret Experiments"
A11_upgrade_area_status:0 "Strength and Prosperity"
A11_secret_bases_desc:0 "The recent achievements within the research team and the increasing demands of the garrison have given rise to a revolutionary idea - Geass-enhanced Knightmares. This concept must remain under every measure of secrecy, our dear witch must go another four hundred meters underground."
A11_upgrade_area_status_desc:0 "Ever since Asprius and Hadleigh shared the reigns over the government, the garrison had been reporting diminishing casualty rates and the stock markets surpassed the moon. Construction, immigration, and applications of honorary citizenships are at an all-time high. Britannian excellence and honoraries' labor is taking Area 11 to a golden era of strength and prosperity."
