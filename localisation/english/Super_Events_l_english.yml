  SUPER_RCW_end_luka_TEXT:0 "The right to govern is not earned. It is taken from those who believe they are capable of doing so but are so blind to their inability to rule that it becomes pathetically easy to take it from them. Emperors and presidents have tried to rule over Russia in the past, but unlike them, I shall remain even after my death. Russia will never be able to escape the shadow that I shall cast upon it until the end of humanity. \n §Y-Luka Zhukov-§"
