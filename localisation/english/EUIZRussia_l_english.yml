EIZ.1.t:0 "Invasion"
EIZ.1.d:0 "President Zakharov stands in his bunker surrounded by his best generals all telling him the impossible. Countless military bases across Russia report coming under attack by civilians bearing various banners. Worse still are the bases who no one can contact, where the bunker’s communications staff confirm they are receiving messages but simply won’t respond to our hails. Seeing the worse, President Zakharov has mobilized all remaining forces and reservists to put down the insurrection; however, it seems as though the Europeans to the west have other ideas. As Zakharov begins issuing orders, reports stream in as outposts on the border with Poland report hostile contacts bearing the insignia of European Peacekeeping forces seemingly headed straight for Moscow."
EIZ.1.a:0 "May God save Russia for I could not…"

EIZ.2.t:0 "Collapse Of Government"
EIZ.2.d:0 "This is IRC reporter Katerin Zelenkov with BREAKING NEWS… after an emergency session of the Council of Europe, International Peacekeeping forces have been sent to secure Moscow after the recent uprisings all across the Former Republic of Russia. At 8:00am Peacekeeper tanks and soldiers were spotted sitting outside the main governing building and rounding up any officials they can find. President Zakharov has noticeably been absent since Peacekeepers crossed the boarder and faced fierce resistance. The situation in Russia is still unknown; however, it seems as though the President and many of his closest advisors have fled the city. Their whereabouts are still unknown."
EIZ.2.a:0 "Issue an arrest warrant for the President and his lackies!"

EIZ.3.t:0 "Collapse of Organized Resistance"
EIZ.3.d:0 "While the Russian Armed Forces was no match for the Counsel’s Peacekeepers, civilian resistance was still strong enough to cause several setbacks. With the President’s disappearance and a renewed effort to crush the armed insurrection, all organized resistance within the territories east of the newly formed Principality of Ekaterinburg have been crushed. It awaits to been seen what the new military government will have in store for the future."
EIZ.3.a:0 "Long live the European Intervention Zone!"

EIZ.31.d:0 "Lyon smiled as he made his way over to Jean Marie, the tall man putting an arm around Lyon turning to his squadron. “This is the man we came here to see, Lyon here saved me in a dogfight. Diving from above towards the enemy tailing me. The crazy bastard pulled up just before they crashed into each other. Because of that the enemy panicked, causing him to roll too hard. The weak man passed out from the G force. I've owed Lyon since then. So, we will be working for him,” Jean said letting out a hearty laugh as he took a step back, Lyon unable to laugh with him, needing to clear his throat before talking. “You're making it sound like you're not getting anything out of this. You aren't going to the front boys. I have something better suiting your skills planned.”"
EIZ.31.a:0 "What is Lyon planning?"

EIZ.32.t:0 "Casablanca Proposal "
EIZ.32.d:0 "Jean stood at the back of the Moroccan commissar's office, listening closely to the conversation. “What could you offer? Working with you makes our position with France even worse. They barely help support me in running the colony as is,” Jean saw the politician smile, clearly this is what he was hoping to hear. “Well that's exactly it. You can work with us, trade with us. You need someone to actually trade with, someone who recognises your authority. While we won't do that. We would be happy to lease out your harbors and cargo ships for our own uses. This could be very good for you. If you play your role and keep your position in mind,” the EIZ representative said with a devious look."
EIZ.32.a:0 "We can take advantage of the colonies France has neglected"

EIZ.34.t:0 "Calling the Pale Jewel"
EIZ.34.d:0 "As Jean helped his men open up the ventral of the air lifts. Allowing the EIZ representatives to unload to meet with the head of the west African confederation. Jean scoffed at the representatives looking at him with caution. The fighters and bombers flying large orbiting above. Only Jean's specialized interceptor following behind the airlifts into a landing, just in case. As Jean heard the Commissar argue against the representatives request, he marched over before calmly putting an arm around the commissar and pointing up at the two squadrons of fighters and bombers. “Those don't look like Union aircraft to me. Hmmm whoever they are, I hope they don't get restless from waiting.” With a silent nod from the commissar he patted the man on the back before heading off to yell at the workers “Hurry up I want these airlifts filled to the brim.”"

EIZ.36.d:0 "Jean climbed out of his interceptor, pacing down the row of aircraft that had gathered together. He couldn't help but become overwhelmed with the possibilities of what he could do with Lyon's funding, especially now that Lyon had made it clear he didn't want to know. Jean's full air wing had arrived, all 1000 men. Aviators, engineers and paradropping specialists all gathered from every corner of Europe. Finally having the chance to get the riches they were owed for their service. Everyone looking south and the weeks ahead."

The airlifts opened their Vectors, Paratroopers dropping down onto the ground hurriedly running into the processing plant. Commanding workers to bring the processed and raw minerals out into the field. The airlifts landing and dropping their Vectors allowing the workers to fill them. Jean dove down and let his guns fire in front of a foramen trying to escape to get help. The airlifts took off ten minutes later filled to the brim, with the PMC following close behind."

EIZ.40.d:0 "Jean personally marched up to the High Commissar smiling brightly as he handed him a sealed envelope. “Nice to meet you, we are your new trading partners.” Jean chirped with a wide grin as behind them, a scene played out of all one thousand men of Jean's all loading up Cargo ships from Morocco, with all the minerals and supplies that were stored up for shipping. “Do not worry, we won't take enough that causes France to rain down hell on you and if you open that envelope in a private space. I'm sure you will find its contents very intriguing. Jean continued to smile as gunfire broke out behind them, suddenly hitting the High Commissar with the butt of his pistol."

Jean punched Lyons arm and cheered as the High Commissar came on screen. “So did I do good in Lyon? I reckon I don't owe you anything anymore,” Jean said playfully as he watched Lyon shake his head. “You convinced a whole continent of colonies to secretly ship as resources and transfer us funds. Just by placing pressure and showing force. I'm amazed you didn't get caught. Now I'm sorry to kick you out but I have a way to finish, I'll see you at the hangar later” Lyon returned to his desk quickly appearing bored again as he read reports from the front. “You need to get back in the air Lyon, you'll die down here otherwise,” Jean called out as he exited the room."
EIZ.43.a:0 "Wait… that, that worked?"

EIZ.44.t:0 "Intervening in the East"

EIZ_Lyons_Air_Force_desc:0 "As a pilot Lyon has always been a proponent of aviation as a decisive factor in winning a war. Now he has complete command of the intervention effort he can finally prove his theories to the doubters in the EU high command. Russia shall be Lyon’s showcase of what air power truly does for a war."
EIZ_Contacts_In_The_ESA:0 "Contacts In The ESA"
EIZ_Contacts_In_The_ESA_desc:0 "Our enemies have proven to be quite formidable on the battlefield, our reconnaissance efforts so far have been subpar which has lost us many battles, we should contact the European Space Agency and request that they provide satellite data on enemy positions to enhance our intelligence on the enemy."
EIZ_Loosen_Rules_of_Engagement:0 "Loosen Rules Of Engagement"
EIZ_Loosen_Rules_of_Engagement_desc:0 "Certain restrictions on engaging the enemy have prevented us from waging an effective war on the Monarchists, Lyon has concocted a plan to overstep certain restrictions to enhance the freedom of our soldiers to “act as they will '' towards the enemy, he hopes this will provide results both in the sky and on the battlefield."
#Lyons Airforce 1 (Supremacy in Numbers)
EIZ_Supremacy_in_Numbers:0 "Supremacy In Numbers"
EIZ_Supremacy_in_Numbers_desc:0 "Our military industrial capability is heavily lacking in its ability to produce aircraft. If we can’t produce enough planes and train enough pilots we will lose this war very quickly. Our strategy must revolve around getting as many planes in the air as possible so we can overwhelm our enemies by sheer strength of numbers."
EIZ_Streamline_Training:0 "Streamline Training"
EIZ_Streamline_Training_desc:0 "Pilot training in the modern age has become increasingly expensive and complicated. It takes months and costs millions to train pilots to EU standards. We must move our training goalposts if we want to keep up with the growing size of our Air Force. Training shall be made quicker, easier and cheaper to perform per-pilot. This strategy harkens back to the late stages of the great war when you learn to fly a plane in 30 minutes (though not quite as quick though…)"
EIZ_More_Pilots_Than_Planes:0 "More Pilots Than Planes"
EIZ_More_Pilots_Than_Planes_desc:0 "It is an inevitable fact that we are going to lose pilots, especially if they do not receive optimal levels of training. Because of this we need to make sure that for every pilot killed in action we have a trained replacement ready to take his place in the sky. This way we can beat the enemy by sheer numbers and industry."
EIZ_Shock_And_Awe:0 "Shock And Awe"
EIZ_Shock_And_Awe_desc:0 "Since our air force is large and widespread we can overwhelm frontline targets with waves of bombers, it doesn’t matter if they shoot one down because another 4 will hit the target in its place. This strategy of shock and awe means the enemy will learn to never crawl out of whatever foxhole they are hiding in for fear of being blasted back to the stone age."
EIZ_Intergrate_Russian_Aircraft:0 "Integrate Russian Aircraft"
EIZ_Intergrate_Russian_Aircraft_desc:0 "Even though we are ramping up our production levels we still lack an immediate reserve of aircraft to achieve our current goals. We can remedy this by seizing the aircraft of the now defunct Russian Republic’s Air Force and pressing their pilots into service. They may not be as capable as EU aircraft being a few generations behind our current levels but if they get shot down we will only lose Russian pilots so who cares?"
EIZ_Contacts_In_Aerospace_Manufacturing:0 "Contacts In Aerospace Manufacturing"
EIZ_Contacts_In_Aerospace_Manufacturing_desc:0 "Building aircraft in Russia presents numerous problems, most immediately is that aircraft factories in Russia are vulnerable to enemy attacks and sabotage. Secondly the Russian aerospace industry we inherited from the republic is woefully inadequate and unable to produce modern aircraft. Luckily we have many contacts with Aerospace defense contractors in Europe who have advanced factories safely away from the war and will happily provide aircraft."
EIZ_Great_War_Levels_Of_Production:0 "Great War Levels Of Production"
EIZ_Great_War_Levels_Of_Production_desc:0 "We need to accelerate our production of aircraft. We shall do this by recreating the great war model of aircraft production. Back then we could produce hundreds of aircraft cheaply and on a wide scale with little need for technical training for the factory workers. Of course the increased cost and complexity of even simplified modern aircraft makes the exact formula impossible but it will work as long as we invest enough into building the factories."
EIZ_Block_Out_The_Sky:0 "Block Out The Sky"
EIZ_Block_Out_The_Sky_desc:0 "We have finally done it! Our aircraft production and pilot recruitment is high enough that we have finally gained an overwhelming numerical superiority over the enemy. It doesn’t matter if they shoot down a plane because we have 5 waiting to replace them with eager pilots waiting as well. In combat we simply smother the enemy with our numbers, we have so many aircraft in the air they can hardly tell the contacts apart on their radar!"

#Lyons Airforce 2 (Supremacy in Technology)
EIZ_Supremacy_in_Technology:0 "Supremacy In Technology"
EIZ_Supremacy_in_Technology_desc:0 "With funding and a whole war to test things out. Lyon can finally follow his dreams of creating the perfect Aircraft and going down as one of the great innovators in aerial warfare. We shall focus on creating advanced aircraft that can dominate the skies even if outnumbered. One good fighter is better than Ten mediocre ones."
EIZ_Encourage_the_Best:0 "Encourage The Best"
EIZ_Encourage_the_Best_desc:0 "A good plane is nothing without an equally good pilot. Our current system of pilot promotion is too bureaucratic and doctrinaire. We need to streamline our system so the truly talented can rise without being constrained by time served or connections."
EIZ_Pilots_Who_Can_Take_on_Armies:0 "Pilots Who Can Take On Armies"
EIZ_Pilots_Who_Can_Take_on_Armies_desc:0 "With our focus on getting better pilots we should also promote the truly great pilots. Those for whom flying is in their blood and carry engagements on their own. Given proper support and advanced aircraft to these Aces will ensure the skies shall be ours."
EIZ_Strike_Hard_Strike_Fast:0 "Strike Hard Strike Fast"
EIZ_Strike_Hard_Strike_Fast_desc:0 "Since we lack a large well defended bomber fleet frontline bombing raids are a suicidal endeavour. Because of this we shall perfect the strategy of strike warfare. Using stealthy and fast multi-role aircraft we can strike important targets behind enemy lines where their defenses are weakest. Exploiting the weaknesses in enemy air defenses means we can destroy these targets before they even have the time to respond. "
EIZ_No_Expense_Spared:0 "No Expense Spared"
EIZ_No_Expense_Spared_desc:0 "Since we are moving away from trying to build a large air force we can instead invest more of our budget into design. We must spare no expense when it comes to making the perfect aircraft, many great projects have been destroyed by budgets and committees and we can’t risk that happening here."
EIZ_Contacts_In_Aerospace_Research:0 "Contacts In Aerospace Research"
EIZ_Contacts_In_Aerospace_Research_desc:0 "The intervention zone does not have much in the way of an aerospace industry or research base. Luckily we can call on our contacts within Europe's military-industrial complex who do have access to aerospace and research assets that we don’t. All we need to do is offer them money and contracts and they should be more than happy to help."
EIZ_The_Perfect_Fighter:0 "The Perfect Fighter"
EIZ_The_Perfect_Fighter_desc:0 "With the blank cheque we have given to European aerospace defense contractors they can now work without restrictions or budget constraints. While this may increase the final production cost of aircraft the combat effectiveness should be truly impressive. Now we can finally equip our pilots with the best."
EIZ_Knights_of_The_Sky:0 "Knights Of The Sky"
EIZ_Knights_of_The_Sky_desc:0 "With the combination of our advanced fighter program and ace pilot initiatives we have finally achieved our dream, to finally be the knights of the sky. Our pilots and their planes are becoming legends of the skies, something akin to the Brittanian knightmare pilots. We shall go down as some of the greatest to ever grace the skies and we are only just beginning…"

#Lyon Economy
EIZ_Lyon_Economic_Board:0 "Lyon's Economic Board"
EIZ_Lyon_Economic_Board_desc:0 "With the European Intervention Zone established, we must focus on our economy as much as our military; without it, we cannot maintain the Zone, let alone the front. To achieve this, we have asked France to send us economists who will establish an economic board with the goal of designing and implementing an economic program for the E.I.Z."
EIZ_casablanca_proposal:0 "Casablanca Proposal"
EIZ_casablanca_proposal_desc:0 "Morocco used to be a shining jewel in the French Empire in the golden days. Today they are a faded protectorate with most of their resources being drained and trade importance lost. Due to this, they have been sorely neglected by the French, but this works out nicely for us. The colonial government has been increasingly dependent on the thriving criminal underworld in casablanca.
We should be able to levy these connections and make them an offer they can’t refuse."
EIZ_calling_the_pale_jewel:0 "Calling The Pale Jewel"
EIZ_calling_the_pale_jewel_desc:0 "Unlike many other colonies like the West African Confederation is not anywhere near as neglected and economically derelict as places like Morocco or Ethiopia. However the government has very amenable anti-colonial members who can be convinced to give us aid if we highlight how our future efforts will damage structures of colonial exploitation. "
EIZ_cook_the_books:0 "Cook The Books"
EIZ_cook_the_books_desc:0 "We must ensure funding and facilities to run our forces and construct new facilities but our mandate was given scarce funding and resources. Neither can we afford to heavily tax the people and create turmoil behind our lines. So we must do something many would consider illegal and this may come back to bite us later but we shall forge and alter documents making it appear as if we have more funding than we actually do and as if we own facilities we did not own before."
EIZ_the_contract:0 "The Contract"
EIZ_the_contract_desc:0 "We need resources as well as cash to sustain the war machine. Luckily Jean-Marie has managed to make contact with a shadowy group of individuals who are interested in funding us. This seems like a promising option though we are currently unsure of what they want from us we are pretty sure that the EU wouldn’t like it. "
EIZ_international_banking_fraud:0 "International Banking Fraud"
EIZ_international_banking_fraud_desc:0 "We need money to sustain the war effort. However the EU are demanding we fight a billion euro war and are giving us the equivalent of pocket change to fight it. Because of this we have to look to less conventional methods to balance the budget. Europe has a vast financial sector which is questionably regulated. While committing mass financial fraud would be damaging Europe's economy as a whole, all we are really doing is taking what they should have given us."
EIZ_send_accountants_to_the_front:0 "Send Inquisitive Accountants To The Front"
EIZ_send_accountants_to_the_front_desc:0 "There are many EIZ officials and accountants who are too clever for their own good.
We have been getting reports of junior officials following the paper trail of our less legal efforts to secure funding and are getting close to collapsing the house of cards that is keeping the EIZ together. We can solve this by making sure they receive postings away from HQ on the front lines where no one will hear from them and if we are lucky they might get themselves killed."
EIZ_off_the_books_trading:0 "Off The Books Trading"
EIZ_off_the_books_trading_desc:0 "Paper trails and bookkeeping only harpers our efforts to secure funding. We can make much better deals with foreign powers to secure resources without Brussels Bureaucrats peering over our receipts and complaining that we are buying from war criminals under EU sanctions. If they spent half the time they did complaining actually giving us money we wouldn’t have to do this in the first place."
EIZ_insider_trading:0 "Insider Trading"
EIZ_insider_trading_desc:0 "War and strife is often a great driver of market change. Given we are in charge of one of the largest European military operations since the Great War we are privy to a lot of market changes.
We could use our knowledge of market trends we shall be creating and profiting from this. We buy up reserves of chromium and then bomb a few mines in the urals and suddenly we are rolling in cash. Stock Trading is fun when you know you will always win."
EIZ_comb_the_prisons_and_banks:0 "Comb The Prisons And Banks"
EIZ_comb_the_prisons_and_banks_desc:0 "Our efforts to secure funding via illegal banking and trading practices may have grown a bit out of our control, long story short we may now be at the center of one of the largest financial conspiracies in European history. To keep up with our growing efforts we shall recruit more shady bankers from europe to help us and even recruit a few white-collar criminals currently languishing in russian prisons, why leave them there when we can have then do some good for us."
EIZ_bribe_officials:0 "Bribe Officials"
EIZ_bribe_officials_desc:0 "As our efforts grow we are starting to fall into the old adage that you need to spend money to make money or in our case you have to spend money to stop the pyramid of fraud from collapsing in on itself. To prevent more people finding out we are having to pay key officials large sums of cash to keep everything under wraps. Luckily the amount we are gaining far offsets the costs we sustain paying people hush money."
EIZ_prepare_for_market_changes:0 "Prepare For Market Changes"
EIZ_prepare_for_market_changes_desc:0 "While we are going to receive direct sources of income from the raids in the form of loot and spoils we would be foolish to overlook the other potential of income this presents. These raids will cause market shockwaves and our prior knowledge should allow us to ride the financial waves to make even more money. We shall contact our friends in finance and tell them to prepare for the storm."
EIZ_ethiopian_haven:0 "Ethiopian Haven"
EIZ_ethiopian_haven_desc:0 "These raids will be highly illegal and off the books. Because of this we must find a base of operations that can not only sustain these operations but is also hidden and out of reach of those who would retaliate. Ethiopia has a large degree of autonomy from the EU and also has a surplus of abandoned airfields that were used during the Somalia Crisis. We can acquire these for our own use and make sure the government in Ethiopia won’t tell Europe about what we are doing."
EIZ_libiyan_raid:0 "The Libyan Raid"
EIZ_libiyan_raid_desc:0 "Libya has many resources that the EU has neglected to protect since the region is mostly peaceful. Since they are not using it we shall claim their bounty for the war effort. Jean-Marie shall lead a string of coordinated airborne raids from the air to loot key industrial facilities of their resources. Since this operation is so outlandish we shall definitely have the element of surprise.
They will never see it coming!"
EIZ_loot_south_africa:0 "Loot South Africa"
EIZ_loot_south_africa_desc:0 "South Africa is one of the more important African holdings for Europe being the largest EU producer of sakuradite. Luckily the stability of the state is built on a house of cards and we should easily be able to storm in and make off with a fortune. The operation shall be targeted to happen whilst the prime-minister is distracted and the high commissioner is out of the country to make sure no one can coordinate a response against us."
EIZ_lyons_magnum_opus:0 "Lyon's Magnum Opus"
EIZ_lyons_magnum_opus_desc:0 "Our mad gambit actually worked! We have bent the rotten colonial superstructure of Africa to our will. Our raids are virtually unopposed and often not even needed as underfunded and intimidated officials just hand over what we want. A whole continent is now ours to plunder without opposition, the bounty of Africa shall pave our way to victory in Russia!"
