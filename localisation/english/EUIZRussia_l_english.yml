EIZ.31.t:0 "A Rowdy Crew"
EIZ.31.d:0 "Lyon smiled as he made his way over to Jean Marie, the tall man putting an arm around Lyon turning to his squadron. “This is the man we came here to see, Lyon here saved me in a dogfight. Diving from above towards the enemy tailing me. The crazy bastard pulled up just before they crashed into each other. Because of that the enemy panicked, causing him to roll too hard. The weak man passed out from the G force. I've owed Lyon since then. So, we will be working for him,” Jean said letting out a hearty laugh as he took a step back, Lyon unable to laugh with him, needing to clear his throat before talking. “You're making it sound like you're not getting anything out of this. You aren't going to the front boys. I have something better suiting your skills planned.”"
EIZ.31.a:0 "What is Lyon planning?"

EIZ.32.t:0 "32"
EIZ.32.d:0 "Jean stood at the back of the Moroccan commissar's office, listening closely to the conversation. “What could you offer? Working with you makes our position with France even worse. They barely help support me in running the colony as is,” Jean saw the politician smile, clearly this is what he was hoping to hear. “Well that's exactly it. You can work with us, trade with us. You need someone to actually trade with, someone who recognises your authority. While we won't do that. We would be happy to lease out your harbors and cargo ships for our own uses. This could be very good for you. If you play your role and keep your position in mind,” the EIZ representative said with a devious look."
EIZ.32.a:0 "We can take advantage of the colonies France has neglected"

EIZ.34.d:0 "As Jean helped his men open up the ventral of the air lifts. Allowing the EIZ representatives to unload to meet with the head of the west African confederation. Jean scoffed at the representatives looking at him with caution. The fighters and bombers flying large orbiting above. Only Jean's specialized interceptor following behind the airlifts into a landing, just in case. As Jean heard the Commissar argue against the representatives request, he marched over before calmly putting an arm around the commissar and pointing up at the two squadrons of fighters and bombers. “Those don't look like Union aircraft to me. Hmmm whoever they are, I hope they don't get restless from waiting.” With a silent nod from the commissar he patted the man on the back before heading off to yell at the workers “Hurry up I want these airlifts filled to the brim.”"

He couldn't help but become overwhelmed with the possibilities of what he could do with Lyon's funding, especially now that Lyon had made it clear he didn't want to know. Jean's full air wing had arrived, all 1000 men. Aviators, engineers and paradropping specialists all gathered from every corner of Europe. Finally having the chance to get the riches they were owed for their service. Everyone looking south and the weeks ahead."

The airlifts opened their Vectors, Paratroopers dropping down onto the ground hurriedly running into the processing plant. Commanding workers to bring the processed and raw minerals out into the field. The airlifts landing and dropping their Vectors allowing the workers to fill them. Jean dove down and let his guns fire in front of a foramen trying to escape to get help. The airlifts took off ten minutes later filled to the brim, with the PMC following close behind."

EIZ.40.d:0 "Jean personally marched up to the High Commissar smiling brightly as he handed him a sealed envelope. “Nice to meet you, we are your new trading partners.” Jean chirped with a wide grin as behind them, a scene played out of all one thousand men of Jean's all loading up Cargo ships from Morocco, with all the minerals and supplies that were stored up for shipping. “Do not worry, we won't take enough that causes France to rain down hell on you and if you open that envelope in a private space. I'm sure you will find its contents very intriguing. Jean continued to smile as gunfire broke out behind them, suddenly hitting the High Commissar with the butt of his pistol."

Jean punched Lyons arm and cheered as the High Commissar came on screen. “So did I do good in Lyon? I reckon I don't owe you anything anymore,” Jean said playfully as he watched Lyon shake his head. “You convinced a whole continent of colonies to secretly ship as resources and transfer us funds. Just by placing pressure and showing force. I'm amazed you didn't get caught. Now I'm sorry to kick you out but I have a way to finish, I'll see you at the hangar later” Lyon returned to his desk quickly appearing bored again as he read reports from the front. “You need to get back in the air Lyon, you'll die down here otherwise,” Jean called out as he exited the room."
EIZ.43.a:0 "Wait… that, that worked?"

EIZ.44.t:0 "Intervening in the East"
EIZ.44.d:0 "PLACEHOLDER, Lyon analysis the situation in the east of Russia. Time to decide who to help, the reds or the lions."
