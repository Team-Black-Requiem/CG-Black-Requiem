CHI_WALTZ_DESC:0 "China heroically stands in the universe, these were the words of the Hongxian Emperor after creating a new dynasty, betraying the Republic. His former socialist comrades rose up against him, only to be put down and chased into the empty western wastelands. Moreover, the High Eunuchs outmanoeuvred the Emperor and reduced him to a puppet.\n\nChina eventually dominated Asia, but it stands divided. A thousand enemies within and without plot to destroy her. Will she wither and die or rise like a phoenix?"

POLITICS_EMPRESS_TIENZI_DESC:0 "While it might be more respectful of human rights than its Britannian counterpart, the Imperial Government of Luoyang, composed by the High Eunuchs, detains all the power and the Empress is only a figurehead, or for some people a puppet. In particular the Imperial Monarchy is highly centralized in the Eunuchs' system at every administrative level, both inside proper China and in the Federation, resulting in a capillar control of society and eventual discontent."

rampant_corruption:0 "Paralyzing Corruption"
rampant_corruption_desc:0 "The eccessive centralization of the Eunuchs; links between the Oligarchy, the industrial corporations and the Army Commanders and a pervasive organized criminality create a massive corruption and inefficiency in the Federation's politics. §RIn the future, this problem is only destined to grow...§!"
social_tensions:0 "High Social Tensions"
social_tensions_desc:0 "All riches are concetrated in the hands of the Eunuchs, resulting in a massive group of starving people in the Federation and a great gap between the various social classes. Poverty is overly diffused among the population and the unrests are barely avoided, but the situation isn't going to improve..."
chinese_dominance:0 "Chinese Supremacy"
chinese_dominance_desc:0 "The Chinese influnce in the Federation, in political and economies terms, is almost absolute and the other members are reduced as slightly autonomus puppets. This permits a great exploitation of the others economies and oppressed populations within the State, favouring Chinese industry and its stability."
industrial_complexes:0 "Military-Industrial Complexes"
industrial_complexes_desc:0 "One of the main forces behind China's success is its developed and diffused industry. With the recent creation of large military-industrial complexes all over the Federation, the Imperial machine-war can compete with its Britannian counter-part; while the imponent manufacturing sector can fight the European colosses."
discontent_army:0 "Officers' Unrests"
discontent_army_desc:0 "While the Army is loyal to the Imperial Monarchy, there's a growing discontent among the young and radical officers, regarding the current status quo. At the moment, thery are not considered dangerous to the Eunuchs, but they are organising into a clique guided by Li Xingke, a prominent general."

chinese_army:0 "The Imperial Army"
chinese_army_desc:0 "The Federal Imperial Army, composed mainly by Chinese soldiers, is withouth a doubt the largest and most compact army in the world, thanks to the extensive conscription in the country. Despite this, there's the necessity of an internal reform because of the numerous limitations in its effectiveness; for example, there are secret reports of corruption between the army ,a doctrine that favours quantity over quality and eventually a severe lack of morale."
wealth_distribution:0 "Suoyou Rén De Cáifù"
wealth_distribution_desc:0 "A Chinese term, meaning Wealth for All; it's utilized to describe the newly proposed project by the Luoyang Government. In particular it's going to utilize parts of the Federation's budget to a limited redistribution among the poor population; although this is just an idea, strongly opposed by the Oligarchy, it will be able to contain the discontent or ,at least, to distract the people..."

#Events
china_fed.1.t:0 "Status Log- Chinese Dragon"
china_fed.1.d:0 "The first papers are obviously dedicated to China proper, where our Imperial bureaucrats have observed the situation in every major city. The country is now somewhat stable and the industrial complexes are fulfilling their quotas without problems.\n\nDespite this, the administration is still overstretched and the state can't reach all its provinces or remote towns. As a result of this, a new internal partition into various "Zones" and a further militarization could be our answers. Furthermore, we should keep an eye on the region of Mongolia, where our secret police has captured numerous spies of the European Union; a new separatist organisation, called White Sun, and supported by the local nomadic tribes, seems to have gained the upper hand on rural areas.\n\nEventually, a misterious guy has been interfering with our business in Shangai and even the local Triads are having troubles with him. They call him "Mao"."
china_fed.1.a:0 "I see."
china_fed.2.t:0 "Status Log- Militarized India"
china_fed.2.d:0 "Next, we are looking at our most valuable colony- ...err we mean Associated State, the Militarized Zone of India. The administration is safely managed by the Imperial Army and its iron grip, with the nominal authority of Maharajah. As a result of this, many tensions, like the Muslim-Hindu conflict and the activity of the Indian Liberation Front, can be suppressed easily.\n\nThe exploitation of its manpower and resources is also going well, but an excessive hand could create dangerous famines, especially in the southern regions, where the economy is not developed enough. Eventually, Maharajah should be checked regularly, considering his unpredictable behavior and his questionable allegiance to the Eunuchs."
china_fed.2.a:0 "Nothing our soldiers can't solve!"
china_fed.3.t:0 "Status Log- Central Asia"
china_fed.3.d:0 "After that, we have the chain of buffer states against EU and Middle East, in the far west of the Chinese Federation. The local governments and garrisons seem to barely control the majority of the vast territory, but there aren't major threats to our rule for now. Despite this, it's important to highlight the low life standars of the population, with the lack of basic services and infrastructures of water, etc. The economy is still pre-industrial and the massive investments in the last Five Year Plan have largely failed their objectives.\n\nEventually, new military support is being requested by the local Imperial Command, since new extremist militias of far-left, but especially far-right islamism, are rising through the unchecked borders, often funded by foreign nations."
china_fed.4.t:0 "Status Log- South East Dominions"
china_fed.4.d:0 "Our borders in the South East region are, by far, the most stable in the Federation, despite the lack of infrastructures among the various states. Our direct control of Singapore assures us a great source of income as well as a total monopoly of the local markets. Furthermore, it is the symbol of our dominance in the area. In particular, the continental states are all ruled by pro-imperial parties or monarchies and they are too weak and small to even try a rebellion.\n\nEventually, two states are synonyms of  problems: the Militarized Philippine and Indonesia. The first one is currently threatened by Britannia and several terrorist attacks are severely damaging the local garrisons, but the situation is still better than the clusterfuck of separatist guerrilla, political violence and local madmens of the Indonesian Federation."
china_fed.4.a:0 "A true nightmare..."
china_fed.3.a:0 "Those deserts still rapresent our backyard."
china_fed.5.t:0 "End of the Report- Afghanistan"
china_fed.5.d:0 "A special observed is the Kingdom of Afghanistan.\n\nThe country is currently the most important hub for illegal trade, such as guns, heroine and oppium, around Eurasia. For this reason, a consistent part of our rule is brokered by local cartels and warlords, or corrupted generals inside the army. Furthermore, a sever inequality plagues the society and the economy is in comatose state. Afghanistan is also the epicentre of the Great Game with the Middle East Federation, which continues to exerts influence among the drug market. Eventually, for its rough terrain, it's also the operative centre of islamist militias and requires a costant military control."
china_fed.5.a:0 "This is definitely a Black Hole for our finances."
china_fed.7.t:0 "New Year, New Parties!"
china_fed.7.d:0 "While the population is still busy with their difficult economic situation ,we should celebrate our riches with fancy private parties in the Imperial Palace. This will be also an occasion to negotiace further privilegies and support among influential generals and industrialists. Furthermore, special sections of our secret police will be guarding all over the place to ensure its security and, maybe, lure Mao into the event and capture him.\n\nUnfortunately, General Li Xingke has already declined the invitation and there won't be any possiblity to get rid of him, for now. Eventually, we have received news of several border skirmishes in our frontier with the Republic of Russia, but we expect a quick de-escalation of the events."
china_fed.7.a:0 "These rats never sleep, huh?"
