molotovism_desc:0 "§YMolotovism§!, officially Marxist-Leninism-Molotovism, is one of the most prominent strain of Left Vanguardism across the globe, despite the EU's best efforts of De-Communisation in the old Soviet Union. Pioneered by Soviet Premier Molotov, it believes a strong party-state is required to lead the revolution and guide the people towards communism. It is also necessary to create a patriotic bureaucratic state with a technocratic command economy operating under Five Year Plans. This type of governance is characterized by a Soviet form of Nationalism and dedication to the conditions for the average citizen, at the cost of a massive surveillance system, managed by the notorious NKGB at the time. In terms of foreign policy, Molotov promoted Realpolitik and at various points sided with and against both the EU and Britannia."

The current generation of National Bolsheviks broadly support socialist economic policies which range from a state capitalist mixed economy to a full command economy. Some strains espouse national syndicalism. Socially, National Bolsheviks are conservative and in some cases reactionary. Chauvinism and cultural supremacy is common in many Nazbol groups with xenophobia is not far behind. Some promote extreme assimilation policies or even a "total solution" to the question of minorities. National Bolsheviks support families values and a return to the church as the center of life. True to their name, National Bolsheviks are nationalists first and foremost. They reject the notion of a world revolution and global communism. Instead, they believe in Bukharin's Socialism in One Country theory. If communism is to achieved, then must be in the nation-state. The foreign policy of National Bolsheviks varies between parties. Some are isolationists and others practice want can be described as "Red Imperialism"."

Practicing and perfecting democratic centralism. It was under Kalinin that the NEP was phased out and a command economy was achieved with the First and Second Five Year plan. However, Kalinin died in 1946 and was replaced by Molotov, who centralised power and purged his opponents. The fall of the Union and the subsequent retreat into Central Asia has caused a reevaluation of Kalinin and his legacy. Marxist-Leninist-Kalininism is moderate strain of centralist socialism. Modern Kalininists support a decentralised one-party state under democratic centralism, a decentralised planned economy, social liberalisation, and multiculturalism in contrast to the Soviet nationalism of Molotovism. They seek to redeem the motherland from her fall and restore the good name of Kalinych"

Eventually, Alexei overruled his uncle and decreed the reopening of the Duma. He wished to form a new government and invited Vladimir Ilyich Lenin to lead it. Lenin accept, but the army stormed the Duma before he could be sworn in, triggering the revolution. Alexei would continue to reign as Tsar until he died  two years later. §YMonarcho-Bolsheviks§! are just as varied and diverse a group as National Bolsheviks. Some, such as the Union of Young Russia (Mladorossi), support fully maintaining the Soviet system with the Tsar as it's head.  Others want a more traditional monarchy and hereditary aristocracy, but support an economy based on collective farms and either guild socialism or workers soviets. There are even those who proposed the reintroduction of serfdom, albeit only for "undesirables". Nearly all Monarcho-Bolsheviks are religious and support the return of the Church to be the center of everyday life. Despite this, some support token progressive reforms.

Illyrian Socialism promotes multiethnic solidarity, workers' self management, and market socialism. These policies were chosen in part due to do the perceived deterioration of the worker's state in the Soviet Union leading to the rise ot a bureaucrat-technocrat clique out of touch with the working class, and mostly due to Molotov's constant backstabbing of both the EU and Britannia leading to on-and-off support to Tito's partisans."

Syndicalism is a very urban ideology, with most of its power and support base coming from urban workers.

Spartanism seeks to save the world from itself and liberate the world from modernity. Stratocracy is seen as the ideal form of government, with the state and army being one and the same. The military is put at the peak of society and the soldier is seen as the most noble, virtuous profession. Slaves are also used in support of the military and slave-soldiers are also employed. A slave-soldier may earn their freedom on the battlefield. So can a gladiator at the Colosseums. Spiritualism is also of great interest to Spartanism, they promote an eclectic, violent brand of spiritualism based on a Cult of the Warrior. Cultural supremacy is strongly desired, with the culture of the conquered totally erased and it's people assimilated into the slave class. Spartanism is represented by the All-Britannian Military Union, with the mainstream "Orthodox" faction led by Princes Castor and Pollux. For now they are little more than a gentlemen's club of military officers and noblemen. However, should the opportunity arrive, they may bring their violent vision into reality."

imperial_cult:0 "Imperial Cult"
imperial_cult_desc:0 "An §YImperial Cult§! is an ancient system of belief, it goes all the way back to the dawn of civilisation. Basically a monarch is worship as a demigod or a full on deity. In modern times, the term is used to refer various ultra-reactionary, ultra-monarchist groups with esoteric beliefs. These groups seek to deify a reigning monarch or openly worship a long dead one. One such group is the Temple of the Hidden Emperor, located in what's now Area 11. The cult have its origins decades earlier with various conspiracy theorists and ultranationalist groups that operated in the tumultuous period after the First Great Pacific War. The Temple considers the currently recognized pretender to the Japanese Throne, Sumeragi Kaguya, is illegitimate. Not least because she is a woman, but also because she is only a niece of the previous Emperor. The Temple supports the Britannian colonial government as they believe half a century under foreign slavery will finally bring the Japanese back to sanity. This is part of their plan to purify Japan for the return of Prince Tenryu. The plan also includes sterilising a third of the Japanese population for being "impure" and exterminating another third for being traitors, as they support the criminal regime of Genbu Kururugi, who debased Japan and prostituted her to foreign bankers. After this and a cultural restoration, Japan will finally be clean enough for the return of Crown Prince Tenryu and he will take his rightful place on the Chrysanthemum Throne."

absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "§YAbsolute Monarchy§! is form of government in which the monarch holds absolute power. Following the doctrine of Absolutism, the monarch's power is unrestrained from all other institutions, be it the church, the legislature, or the social elite. The monarch's rule is legitimised by the "divine right of kings". The monarch is not accountable to the authority of man, rather their right to rule is derived the divine. They are only accountable to God. The monarch is not subject to the will of the people or of the aristocracy. Despite this, the monarch is not worshipped as a god, rather is seen as God's highest representative on earth. Absolute monarchies are characterised by a bureaucracy and government apparatus focus solely on the monarch. The monarch can dissolve the government at will and can freely appoint whoever they want to any office in the government or the military. The monarch also acts as the paramount military leader. A strong standing army is a necessity to maintain and expand the power and influence of the monarch.  The economy serves to enrich the monarch and those in their inner circle. Exactly what form this takes depends on the policies of individual monarch, it may take the form of mercantilism, free market capitalism, or corporatism. Absolute monarchies tend to be rather traditionalist and in some cared reactionary. However, there also exists "enlightened absolutists". Monarchs who are influenced by the Enlightenment and seek to use it's idea to enhance their power."

romano_brit_desc:0 "§YRomano Britannianism§! is the ideology developed by the Young Guard faction of the All-Britannian Military Union. Unlike the Orthodox and the Ultra Spartanist factions, the Young Guard look to Rome rather than Sparta for inspiration. They seek for Britannia to emulate Rome in terms of military, politics, and culture. This has caused them to develop such heterodox proposals like the Britannian Emperor be an elected position chosen by a senate, tolerating the culture of the Numbers instead of erasing it, and strangest of all, martial pacifism, the idea of war only in self defense. Despite this, they still support a rigid class system, de-urbanisation, agrarianism, and mass slavery like the mainstream All-Britannian Military Union"

britannian_con_desc:0 "§YBritannian Constitutionalism§! is an ideology that evolved over the centuries. At first it was merely a form of conservative parliamentarianism, then it became a form of civic nationalism, and now it is an Absolutist ultra-monarchist legalist ideology. It views the unwritten Constitution of Britannia as a perfect text, a sacred text and no new laws can be created. Only interpretations of the current laws are allowed. They view the Emperor as the highest authority on earth and his word is law. Even if what he says contradicts the Constitution, it must be done as he is the personification of the Constitution. The Britannian Constitutionalists dedication to Emperor, the Empire and her laws is so fanatical that even the Purists think they are mentally disturbed."

geass_cult:"Cult of the Geass"
geass_cult_desc:0 "§YCult of Geass§! is the religion of the Geass Order. An esoteric, arcane faith as ancient as humanity itself, only a select few know it's full teachings. The Cult believes that free will is the source of all evil and seeks to control mankind through subtle means. Using the mystical force known as Geass, they have manipulated important events throughout history, with varying degrees of success. The Cult is split between two factions; the followers of the teachings of the Pontiff of Megiddo, who want to initiation Ragnarok, and the agents of the renegade known only as the Son of Perun, who has his own plans with Geass and God. Between the two, there is an unofficially third faction, the Enlightened Inquisition, who merely wish to continue the status quo indefinitely and control world events behind the scenes"

jupiter_cult:0 "Cult of Jupiter"
jupiter_cult_desc:0 "The §YChildren of Jupiter§! are a secret religious brotherhood that is trapped in an eternal war with the Geass Order. The Children are the remnants of a once larger faith that originated in Atlantis, it's current form was established in the Roman Republic. Unlike the Geass Order, the Children believe that mankind deserves free will because it is both a blessing and a curse. Man is cursed to be free, he is responsible for his own suffering. Yet, with the light of God through Geass, he can achieve his own salvation. Despite their name, the Children don't actually worship Jupiter. They worship the source of existence itself, the progenitor of Geass, an entity known as The Monad in their texts. However, the name remained as they have been called that for so long. It was maintained as to honour those who came before. The Children of Jupiter's main goal is the extinction of the Geass Order, none of it's members must be left alive and all their heretical works must be burned. Once this is achieved, the Children shall reveal themselves to the world and bring Geass to all mankind. Ushering a new and terrifying age."

national_syndacalism_desc:0 "A rather infamous ideology that haunts right-wing circles is §YNational Syndicalism§!. As it's name implies, it's a more nationalist implementation of syndicalism. Unlike many leftist ideologies, such as Marxism, which promotes itself as a "scientific" ideology based on critical analysis of the current economic system. National Syndicalism is based on the power of myth. It mythologised the strike, the worker, and working class life. Violence, especially revolutionary violence, is promoted and is considered to have a metaphysical, transformative power. National Syndicalists will implement the unionisation of society. Society will be split among "producer" and "consumer" unions. Together, they all work together to achieve the best, calibrated, and optimal economy. Corporations are to be nationalised and private property abolished. Socially, National Syndicalists support vitalism and the creation of a New Man. Violence, hyper-masculinity, and anti-individualism is promoted. Most National Syndicalists support a patriarchal society, with women as wives and mothers. Immigration is to be tightly controlled in a National Syndicalist state, as to prevent foreigners from stealing local jobs or corrupt the culture. National Syndicalists are against what they see as bourgeois degeneration. National Syndicalists believe in the state above all and they intend to put the church and religion in general under the state. Militarism is seen as positive under national syndicalism and paramilitary organisations are promoted. National Syndicalists seek to expand the borders of the homeland to secure resources and "living space" for the people."
yamato_militarism:0 "Yamato Militarism"
yamato_militarism_desc:0 "§YYamato Militarism§! is another ideology that emerged from the failure of the Bloody Summer Uprising. Unlike Japanese Neo Feudalism, it blamed the failure of the revolt on the Japanese people, as a race, being made weak by the decades of economic stability brought by the Sakuradite monopoly and the Japanese democratic tradition. They look to the future, they want a new Yamato race to arise and eventually bring the fight to Britannia. Yamato Militarism aims to turn Japan into a stratocracy, a military with a state. They also promote Xenophobia that rivals the Purists of Britannia, as they seek to purify Japan of all foreign elements. Not just from politics and day to day life, but even to cultural and language. At this very moment, they are developing a version of the Japanese language purified of all foreign influence and simplified as to make dissent impossible. After all, how can you rebel if you can't even say the words that are required. These words no longer exist."

WALTZ_LOC:0 "During the last decades three superpowers had been expanding their power: the Britannian Empire, the Chinese Federation and the Europian Universe. They had developed different political and social systems, but their goal is the same- dominate the entire world. As a result of the competition, only few nations have remained independent, struggling to survive between the three Leviathans. Until today, a fragile peace have been preserved; however with the recent tensions in the Pacific and a potential international crisis, nobody knows if this three-sided waltz will survive..."

OTHER_WALTZ_DESC:0 "Almost all nations in Earth are under the banner of one of the three superpowers, namely China, Britannia or United Europe. There are two exceptions in this order: Japan and the Middle Eastern Federation.\n\nThe first nation, also called the "Jewel of the Pacific" is the only democracy in the Pacific, and it's only alive thanks to its Sakuradite deposits; a similar logic can be applied to the Middle East. Will these territories be subjugated or their independence ethos will survive?"
