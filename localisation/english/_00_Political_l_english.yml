Named after and pioneered by Soviet Premier Yyacheslav Molotov, it believes a strong party-state is required to lead the revolution and guide the people towards communism. During Molotov's Premiership, he created a patriotic bureaucratic state with a technocratic command economy operating under the famous Five Year Plans. The Soviet Union under Molotov was characterised by a by a Soviet form of nationalism and massive socioeconomic improvements for the average citizen, at the cost of being under a massive surveillance state under the notorious NKGB. In terms of foreign policy, Molotov promoted Realpolitik and at various points sided with and against both the EU and Britannia."

The current generation of National Bolsheviks broadly support socialist economic policies which range from a state capitalist mixed economy to a full command economy. Some strains espouse national syndicalism. Socially, National Bolsheviks are conservative and in some cases reactionary. Chauvinism and cultural supremacy is common in many Nazbol groups with xenophobia is not far behind. Some promote extreme assimilation policies or even a "total solution" to the question of minorities. National Bolsheviks support families values and a return to the church as the center of life. True to their name, National Bolsheviks are nationalists first and foremost. They reject the notion of a world revolution and global communism. Instead, they believe in Bukharin's Socialism in One Country theory. If communism is to achieved, then must be in the nation-state. The foreign policy of National Bolsheviks varies between parties. Some are isolationists and others practice want can be described as "Red Imperialism"."

Practicing and perfecting democratic centralism. It was under Kalinin that the NEP was phased out and a command economy was achieved with the First and Second Five Year plan. However, Kalinin died in 1946 and was replaced by Molotov, who centralised power and purged his opponents. The fall of the Union and the subsequent retreat into Central Asia has caused a reevaluation of Kalinin and his legacy. Marxist-Leninist-Kalininism is moderate strain of centralist socialism. Modern Kalininists support a decentralised one-party state under democratic centralism, a decentralised planned economy, social liberalisation, and multiculturalism in contrast to the Soviet nationalism of Molotovism. They seek to redeem the motherland from her fall and restore the good name of Kalinych"

monarcho_bolshevism_desc:0 "In 1916, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was assassinated and his son, Alexei became Emperor. Due to his age and health, he was put under the Regency of his uncle. Eventually, Alexei overruled his uncle and decreed the reopening of the Duma. He wished to form a new government and invited Vladimir Ilyich Lenin to lead it. Lenin accept, but the army stormed the Duma before he could be sworn in, triggering the revolution. Alexei would continue to reign as Tsar until he died  two years later. §YMonarcho-Bolsheviks§! are just as varied and diverse a group as National Bolsheviks. Some, such as the Union of Young Russia (Mladorossi), support fully maintaining the Soviet system with the Tsar as it's head.  Others want a more traditional monarchy and hereditary aristocracy, but support an economy based on collective farms and either guild socialism or workers soviets. There are even those who proposed the reintroduction of serfdom, albeit only for "undesirables". Nearly all Monarcho-Bolsheviks are religious and support the return of the Church to be the center of everyday life. Despite this, some support token progressive reforms. In terms of foreign affairs, Monarcho-Bolsheviks are split between isolationists and "red imperialists"."

Developed by the Illyrian Bolshevik Josip Tito, who became known as the Partisan King of the Balkans due to his long and brutal resistance campaign against the Danubian Federation. Illyrian Socialism promotes multiethnic solidarity, workers' self management, and market socialism. These policies were chosen in part due to do the perceived deterioration of the worker's state in the Soviet Union leading to the rise ot a bureaucrat-technocrat clique out of touch with the working class, and mostly due to Molotov's constant backstabbing of both the EU and Britannia leading to on-and-off support to Tito's partisans."

Yet, abandon the notion that socialism can be achieved peacefully as proposed by Lincoln and the thesis that democracy is required for socialism as written by Marx. Only through violent, all encompassing revolution can mankind achieve communism. The Marxist-Lincolnites reject reformism and parliamentarianism.

Economically, Anarcho-Communists are likewise split between those who advocate a gift economy and the abolition of money, and those who prefer a form of free-market anarchism based around communes and workers cooperatives, along with replacing money with labour vouchers and a return to barter.

Though most Anarcho-Communists are atheists or at least anti-clerical, they nevertheless allow the faithful to practice their religions as to deny them that would be against the individualist principle of anarchism.

Civil disobedience and the creation of libertarian communities are the main tools of Anarcho-Pacifism. Some advocate a return to agrarian ruralism, while others wish to maintain the current industrialised world while making it more eco-friendly and under worker control. Many advocate a gift economy or a return to barter. Not only do anarcho-pacifists wish to abolish the state, they also want to abolish police and militaries. Believing all issues can be delt with peacefully through talks, negotiations, and compromise. Socially, Anarcho-Pacifists accept all regardless of background and beliefs, along with oppressed groups like minorities and the queer.

Such as ending monopolies and taking down landlords. Due to their base of support being rural farmers, Agrarian Socialists tend to have rather conservative social views. They support traditional families and the role of the church in daily life. Urban liberals and feminists are viewed with suspicion and contempt. Despite this, some agrarian socialists support limited progressive reforms. Such as free education and universal health care. Along with token women's rights reforms.

They denounce the criminal demagoguery of the Molotovists, the corrupt bureaucratism of the Syndicalists, and the incompetent impotence of the centrists across Russia along with the EU. They vow fulfil the goals and dreams of both the 1905 and 1917 Revolutionists. In order of achieve this, they resorted to some of the same tactics of their hated rivals, the Bolsheviks. The Neo-Mensheviks support the creation of a secret police to deal with "dangerous elements" in society, political commissars to oversee the military, and some say even a restoration of the dreaded GULAG labour camps.

Followed by the implementation of industrial democracy, the abolishment of political parties, and top-down authority being reduced to a bare minimum. Syndicalists are split between two fractions, the "Revolutionary" Syndicalists and the "Anarcho-Syndicalists". The Revolutionary Syndicalists prefer the creation of "One Big Union" while Anarcho-Syndicalists wish to maintain the Popular Front of various trade unions. The Revolutionary fraction wishes to maintain the state, albeit under a heavily decentralised federal form. While the Anarchist fraction wishes to dissolve completely and replace it with a confederation of self-governing communes. Both support abolishing standing armies and replacing with militias under the control of soldiers' councils with democratically elected officers. Syndicalism is a very urban ideology, with most of its power and support base coming from urban workers. They have a skeptical view of the rural countryside, with many seeing the peasants as reactionaries. Many syndicalists in both fractions support mass urbanisation and mass industrialisation, a "Great Sprint Forwards"."

In stead of tearing down capitalism to make way for socialism, they intend to use capitalism to destroy capitalism. This caused them to adopt a strong welfare state, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, free education, and a social market economy. Instead of class conflict, they promote class cooperation by means of collective bargaining between business owners and trade unions. They support the creation of cooperatives and are friendly towards minorities (both racial and sexual). Many promote the creation of an international organisation to facilitate cooperation between the nations and solve issues using diplomacy. Despite their seemingly utopian image, history shows they can be as treacherous as their centralist rivals. Many social democrats likewise have no problem exploiting the prejudices of society in order to win votes. There also have been high profile cases of social democratic governments siding with the corporations and willingly throwing the working class under the bridge. Despite their commitment to creating socialism democratically, many say all that they are creating a form of red capitalism. In any case, the social democrats stand firm to their convictions.

As such, Reformist Socialists fully support taking part in elections and the creation of parliaments. Economically, Reformist Socialism believes the way to create socialism is through a welfare state, managerialism, and the computerisation of the economy. Trade Unions are given a less prominent role, as the corruption among unions become more widely known. Some Reformist Socialists support Business Unionism and more automation in the economy. What really separates reformist socialists from other socialists is their support of youth movements.

As such Japan is one of the most corporate friendly countries in the world. With many public facilities and services being outsourced to private entities. Welfare is likewise mostly provided by corporations. Due to their excessive influence, the Zaibatsus have dubbed an unofficial branch of the government.

Elections would be conducted and monitored by the military as to avoid "irregularities" or they would declare a state of emergency, suspending elections until a later "safer" time. The economy and society would be subjected to a "Military First" policy, with military needs being the focus of the economy, neglecting consumer goods, and the civilian population being prepared to support and serve the military. Youth organisations like the Scouts would be used to prepare children for the military and civilians would be trained to formed loyal militias.

Spiritualism is also of great interest to Spartanism, they promote an eclectic, violent brand of spiritualism based on a Cult of the Warrior.

The plan also includes sterilising a third of the Japanese population for being "impure" and exterminating another third for being traitors, as they support the criminal regime of Genbu Kururugi, who debased Japan and prostituted her to foreign bankers.

Unlike the Orthodox and the Ultra Spartanist factions, the Young Guard look to Rome rather than Sparta for inspiration. They seek for Britannia to emulate Rome in terms of military, politics, and culture. This has caused them to develop such heterodox proposals like the Britannian Emperor be an elected position chosen by a senate, tolerating the culture of the Numbers instead of erasing it, and strangest of all, martial pacifism, the idea of war only in self defense. Despite this, they still support a rigid class system, de-urbanisation, agrarianism, and mass slavery like the mainstream All-Britannian Military Union"

britannian_con:0 "Britannian Constitutionalism"
britannian_con_desc:0 "§YBritannian Constitutionalism§! is an ideology that evolved over the centuries. At first it was merely a form of conservative parliamentarianism, then it became a form of civic nationalism, and now it is an Absolutist ultra-monarchist legalist ideology. It views the unwritten Constitution of Britannia as a perfect text, a sacred text and no new laws can be created. Only interpretations of the current laws are allowed. They view the Emperor as the highest authority on earth and his word is law. Even if what he says contradicts the Constitution, it must be done as he is the personification of the Constitution. The Britannian Constitutionalists dedication to Emperor, the Empire and her laws is so fanatical that even the Purists think they are mentally disturbed."

geass_cult:"Cult of the Geass"
geass_cult_desc:0 "§YCult of Geass§! is the religion of the Geass Order. An esoteric, arcane faith as ancient as humanity itself, only a select few know it's full teachings. The Cult believes that free will is the source of all evil and seeks to control mankind through subtle means. Using the mystical force known as Geass, they have manipulated important events throughout history, with varying degrees of success. The Cult is split between two factions; the followers of the teachings of the Pontiff of Megiddo, who want to initiation Ragnarok, and the agents of the renegade known only as the Son of Perun, who has his own plans with Geass and God. Between the two, there is an unofficially third faction, the Enlightened Inquisition, who merely wish to continue the status quo indefinitely and control world events behind the scenes"

jupiter_cult:0 "Cult of Jupiter"
jupiter_cult_desc:0 "The §YChildren of Jupiter§! are a secret religious brotherhood that is trapped in an eternal war with the Geass Order. The Children are the remnants of a once larger faith that originated in Atlantis, it's current form was established in the Roman Republic. Unlike the Geass Order, the Children believe that mankind deserves free will because it is both a blessing and a curse. Man is cursed to be free, he is responsible for his own suffering. Yet, with the light of God through Geass, he can achieve his own salvation. Despite their name, the Children don't actually worship Jupiter. They worship the source of existence itself, the progenitor of Geass, an entity known as The Monad in their texts. However, the name remained as they have been called that for so long. It was maintained as to honour those who came before. The Children of Jupiter's main goal is the extinction of the Geass Order, none of it's members must be left alive and all their heretical works must be burned. Once this is achieved, the Children shall reveal themselves to the world and bring Geass to all mankind. Ushering a new and terrifying age."

yamato_militarism_desc:0 "§YYamato Militarism§! is another ideology that emerged from the failure of the Bloody Summer Uprising. Unlike Japanese Neo Feudalism, it blamed the failure of the revolt on the Japanese people, as a race, being made weak by the decades of economic stability brought by the Sakuradite monopoly and the Japanese democratic tradition. They look to the future, they want a new Yamato race to arise and eventually bring the fight to Britannia. Yamato Militarism aims to turn Japan into a stratocracy, a military with a state. They also promote Xenophobia that rivals the Purists of Britannia, as they seek to purify Japan of all foreign elements. Not just from politics and day to day life, but even to cultural and language. At this very moment, they are developing a version of the Japanese language purified of all foreign influence and simplified as to make dissent impossible. After all, how can you rebel if you can't even say the words that are required. These words no longer exist."

WALTZ_LOC:0 "During the last decades three superpowers had been expanding their power: the Britannian Empire, the Chinese Federation and the Europian Universe. They had developed different political and social systems, but their goal is the same- dominate the entire world. As a result of the competition, only few nations have remained independent, struggling to survive between the three Leviathans. Until today, a fragile peace have been preserved; however with the recent tensions in the Pacific and a potential international crisis, nobody knows if this three-sided waltz will survive..."

OTHER_WALTZ_DESC:0 "Almost all nations in Earth are under the banner of one of the three superpowers, namely China, Britannia or United Europe. There are two exceptions in this order: Japan and the Middle Eastern Federation.\n\nThe first nation, also called the "Jewel of the Pacific" is the only democracy in the Pacific, and it's only alive thanks to its Sakuradite deposits; a similar logic can be applied to the Middle East. Will these territories be subjugated or their independence ethos will survive?"
