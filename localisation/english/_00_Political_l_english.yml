revolutionary_jacobinism:0 "Revolutionary Jacobinism"
revolutionary_jacobinism_desc:0 "In a world seemingly detached from the tumultuous eras of revolutions past, it comes as a surprise to many that remnants of an ideology once despised and feared still find supporters in the contemporary landscape. §YRevolutionary Jacobinism§!, a modern incarnation of its historical namesake, persists as a striking amalgamation of collectivist economic doctrines and liberal social policies. Despite its tarnished reputation, this ideology continues to attract adherents drawn to its vision of societal equality and nationalist fervor. Delving into its tenets reveals a complex political structure wherein a charismatic leader reigns supreme, supported by a council comprising influential figures within the Jacobin movement. Strikingly, measures akin to those employed by despotic regimes of yore, such as secret police and youth organizations, are utilized to root out dissent and solidify power. Even in matters of foreign policy, Revolutionary Jacobinism exhibits a willingness to align with left-wing ideologies, albeit pragmatically adjusting its stance when survival demands."

military_bolshevism:0 "Military Bolshevism"
military_bolshevism_desc:0 "§YMilitary Bolshevism§! is a form of Socialism that emphasizes the militarization of society and the central role of the military in the revolutionary process. Military Bolshevism advocates for the establishment of a highly disciplined and centralized military structure within the revolutionary state, with the belief that the military should serve as the vanguard of the proletarian revolution. This ideology prioritizes the use of force and coercion to achieve revolutionary goals, often employing harsh measures to suppress opposition and maintain control. Military Bolshevism seeks to consolidate power through the militarization of key institutions and the imposition of strict discipline on both the military and civilian populations. It represents a radical interpretation of Marxist principles, emphasizing the primacy of armed struggle in achieving and preserving socialist transformation."

national_bolshevism:0 "National Bolshevism"
national_bolshevism_desc:0 "§YNational Bolshevism§! represents a fusion of socialist economic principles with fervent nationalism. Advocating for a spectrum of socialist economic models, from state capitalism to full command economies, National Bolsheviks lean towards conservatism and, in some instances, reactionary tendencies. They often espouse chauvinistic attitudes and cultural supremacy, sometimes advocating for extreme assimilation policies or even proposing drastic measures regarding minority populations. Emphasizing traditional family values and a resurgence of religious influence, particularly the centrality of the church, is central to their platform. Above all, National Bolsheviks prioritize nationalism, rejecting the concept of global communism and instead embracing Bukharin's Socialism in One Country theory. Their foreign policy approaches vary, with some favoring isolationism while others exhibit what could be termed as "Red Imperialism.""

balkan_socialism:0 "Balkan Socialism"
balkan_socialism_desc:0 "In contrast to other bureaucratic and technocratic strains of Communism, §YBalkan Socialism§! embodies a cult of heroism, centering on the leadership of partisans who actively engage in revolution. Crafted by Josip Tito, the Croatian Bolshevik renowned as the "Wolf of the Balkans" for his relentless resistance against the Danubian Federation and Europia, this ideology advocates for a mildly decentralized state. It fosters a vision of multiethnic brotherhood and solidarity. Key tenets include workers' self-management facilitated by factory councils akin to the Soviets, alongside mixed economic policies such as market socialism. These states often oscillate between firm governance and internal concessions, rendering them inherently unstable and prone to discontent, resembling a powder keg awaiting ignition."

centralist_communism:0 "Centralist Communism"
centralist_communism_desc:0 "§YCentralist Communism§! vehemently opposes Technocracy and Federalism, prioritizing the partecipation of the common folk over technocratic elites in the Party Apparatus. This ideology rejects the notion of technocratic rule, advocating instead for a system that reveres a cult of the simple life, valuing the wisdom and experience of ordinary citizens. It emphasizes the importance of grassroots involvement and collective decision-making to ensure policies align with the needs of the broader population. However, Centralist Communism also maintains a totalitarian and hyper-centralist vision of the state, where a single ruling Communist party holds absolute authority. Despite its focus on the simple life, this ideology imposes strict control over all aspects of society and economy, limiting individual liberties in favor of collective goals and state supremacy. Eventually, minorities are perceived as posing a threat to the social cohesion of the nation, and any pursuit of autonomy is viewed as undermining the unity of the State."

technocratic_communism:0 "Technocratic Communism"
technocratic_communism_desc:0 "§YTechnocratic Communism§! stands out among Vanguardist movements for its belief in the necessity of a robust party-state to spearhead the revolution towards Communism. It envisions an ideal government as a patriotic bureaucracy, implementing a technocratic command economy through the execution of famous Five Year Plans. This ideology is marked by a strong sense of nationalism and a commitment to achieving socioeconomic progress for the common citizen, even if it means subjecting them to extensive surveillance under the watchful eye of a formidable secret police. In matters of foreign policy, it adopts a pragmatic approach, demonstrating readiness to negotiate and engage with non-Communist forces."

Traditionally, it envisions replacing the state with a confederation of self-governing village communes and city-states, while modern proponents lean towards decentralized federalism. Economically, Anarcho-Communists are divided between those supporting a gift economy and the elimination of money, and those favoring a free-market anarchism model with communes and workers' cooperatives, substituting money with labor vouchers and barter. Anarcho-Communists staunchly oppose discrimination and champion the rights of marginalized groups, including women, and minorities. While many are atheists or anti-clerical, they respect religious freedom, though some are anti-theistic and advocate for the eradication of religion altogether."

anarcho_pacifism_desc:0 "§YAnarcho-Pacifism§! represents an anarchist ideology that steadfastly opposes violence, advocating instead for peaceful methods of resistance in the pursuit of social transformation. Rejecting violence as antithetical to anarchist principles like the rejection of hierarchy and domination, Anarcho-Pacifists rely on civil disobedience and the establishment of libertarian communities as primary tools for change. Some proponents advocate for a return to agrarian ruralism, while others seek to reconcile industrialization with ecological sustainability and worker control. Many endorse a gift economy or a revival of barter systems. Anarcho-Pacifists not only aim to abolish the state but also advocate for the elimination of police and military forces, believing that all conflicts can be peacefully resolved through dialogue, negotiation, and compromise.

left_libertarianism_desc:0 "§YLeft Libertarianism§! encompasses a spectrum of egalitarian, anti-authoritarian ideologies that prioritize both individual freedom and social equality. Opposing capitalism and private property, adherents support personal property rights and advocate for common or social ownership of the means of production, ranging from market anarchism to decentralized planned economies. What sets Left Libertarians apart is their steadfast commitment to personal autonomy and civil liberties, often advocating for free thought and the abolition of traditional family structures. Women's rights are a key focus, with many seeking to dismantle patriarchal systems.

Denouncing bureaucratic corruption and political ineffectiveness, they strive to fulfill the goals of past revolutionaries. In pursuit of these aims, they employ tactics reminiscent of their Bolshevik rivals, supporting the creation of a secret police and political commissars in the military.

syndacalism:0 "Syndicalism"
syndacalism_desc:0 "§YSyndicalism§!, rooted in direct action to dismantle capitalism, encompasses a range of tactics such as general strikes, industrial sabotage, and armed insurrection. Following the revolution, syndicalists envision the transfer of control over the means of production to trade unions, radically altering societal and political structures to prioritize industrial democracy. This restructuring includes the dissolution of political parties and the reduction of top-down authority. Within syndicalist circles, there exist distinct factions: "Revolutionary" Syndicalists advocate for a decentralized federal state, while "Anarcho-Syndicalists" seek the dissolution of the state in favor of self-governing communes. Some radical factions even advocate for the replacement of standing armies with militias under democratic control. Syndicalism's urban focus draws significant support from urban workers, who often view rural areas with skepticism. Many syndicalists promote mass urbanization and industrialization, termed as a "Great Sprint Forwards," to bolster their movement."

utopian_communism_desc:0 "§YUtopian Communists§!, known as the Idealists, advocates for a revival of Ivan's style of communism, rejecting Technocratic Marxism in favor of a more revolutionary approach. They assert that true communism can only be achieved through class struggle and the overthrow of a corrupt system. Rather than relying on bureaucratic structures, they believe in empowering the proletariat to lead the charge for change. Their policies include the abolition of political parties in the People's Congress, the implementation of class warfare, collectivization of resources, abolition of private property, communalization of society, and the establishment of a revolutionary militia. They argue that these measures are necessary steps towards the ultimate goal of communism, where power and resources are shared equally among all members of society."

Departing from the path of radical revolutionary change, they assert that Ivan's demise marked the failure of such endeavors and advocate for calculated pragmatic shifts as the most viable route to communism. This faction's approach prioritizes compromise and coalition-building, exemplified by their involvement in the Unity Coalition within the People's Congress. They advocate for compromises with the petite bourgeoisie and reject collectivization, instead favoring market socialist tendencies and permitting limited property ownership. Revisionary Communists advocate for a centralized security apparatus to maintain stability while implementing policies geared towards gradual socioeconomic transformation, aiming to navigate the complexities of transition towards communism with pragmatism and calculated deliberation."


agrarian_socialism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"

They also seek to dismantle monopolies and challenge landlord dominance. With a support base rooted in rural communities, Agrarian Socialists often hold conservative social values, emphasizing traditional family structures and the influence of the church. They view urban liberals skeptically, though some endorse limited progressive reforms such as free education and healthcare, along with token women's rights measures. More radical factions embrace green politics, including environmentalism and social justice, while prioritizing grassroots democracy."

social_monarchism_desc:0 "§YSocial Monarchism§!, also known as Bolshevik Monarchism, is a distinct ideological blend that marries traditional absolutist monarchy with socialist principles. In this system, the monarch wields unchecked authority while socialist policies are enforced by the state. Unlike constitutional monarchies, where power is limited by law, Social Monarchism advocates for a ruler with absolute control, symbolizing national unity and tradition. Socialist ideals such as wealth redistribution and state ownership of key industries are implemented under the monarch's decree. Despite the absolutist nature of the monarchy, this ideology still emphasizes socioeconomic equality and the welfare of the working class, albeit under the firm grip of monarchical authority. Social Monarchism seeks to harmonize historical monarchy with progressive socialist objectives, creating a regime that blends tradition with centralized governance and socialist policies."

Instead of dismantling capitalism, they aim to leverage it against itself, resulting in a robust welfare state, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, free education, and a social market economy. Emphasizing class cooperation over conflict, they endorse collective bargaining and support cooperatives while championing minority rights. Many advocate for international cooperation through diplomacy. Despite their perceived utopianism, historical instances of betrayal and opportunism exist, including aligning with corporate interests and exploiting societal prejudices for electoral gain.

Economically, Reformist Socialism promotes socialism through the establishment of a robust welfare state, managerialism, and economic computerization, while diminishing the influence of Trade Unions due to pervasive corruption. Some proponents endorse Business Unionism and increased automation. Notably, they champion youth movements to counter gerontocracy and address youth disillusionment, aiming to promote young members to leadership positions.

Its primary aim is to balance traditional paternalistic values of the Empire with modern democratic principles. As such, it promotes a hybrid system, akin to a semi-constitutional monarchy, with dual leadership vested in both the Prime Minister and the Empress. This ideology prioritizes the gradual eradication of discrimination and cultural xenophobia, especially regarding the Numbers, marking a departure from past imperial policies. It also champions limited press freedom and fosters an environment conducive to open discourse and exchange of ideas. Britannian Constitutionalism seeks to foster national unity and stability through a transparent and accountable government, marking a departure from past authoritarianism.

They advocate for a meritocratic leadership structure, where individuals ascend based on competence and loyalty to the party's principles rather than through competitive elections. Critics, however, raise concerns about the potential for authoritarianism and lack of pluralism inherent in such a system, warning against the suppression of dissenting voices and the erosion of democratic principles.

The government maintains a strong grip on power, often justifying its actions as necessary for the stability and development of the nation. Critics argue that Authoritarian Democracy undermines the principles of genuine democracy, as it prioritizes the consolidation of power over the rights and freedoms of the people.

While the monarch may retain ceremonial or symbolic roles, real political power is often vested in the constitutional government. This system aims to blend the stability and continuity associated with monarchy with the principles of democracy and rule of law.

In modern iterations, military governments often cloak their rule with claims of defending democracy or maintaining order through puppet civilian administrations. They may manipulate political processes by reserving parliamentary seats for military officials or overseeing rigged elections under the guise of ensuring stability. A "Military First" policy prioritizes military needs over civilian goods and services, with society geared towards supporting and serving the military.

Central to this ideology is the concept of maintaining a robust, adaptable Britannia capable of thriving amidst global challenges. Power predominantly rests in the hands of the Prime Minister, enabling efficient governance. The Britannian parliament serves primarily as an advisory body, facilitating discussion and addressing grievances.

Genbu justifies this concentration of power as necessary for navigating Japan through tumultuous times. He wields a plethora of emergency powers and has suspended parliament on numerous occasions, thwarting attempts to remove him from office. Genbu's government maintains close ties with corporations, resulting in Japan becoming exceptionally corporate-friendly, with many public services outsourced to private entities. Despite this, Genbu remains autonomous, occasionally nationalizing corporations displaying disloyalty or collusion with foreign powers.

Federalist elements are incorporated to ensure regional representation and autonomy within the overarching imperial structure. Despite the absolute authority of the monarch, federal institutions and regional leaders play a role in governance, contributing to a balance between centralization and decentralization. This ideology aims to maintain stability, uphold Christian values, and promote the prosperity of the realm under the auspices of a benevolent and enlightened monarch."

britannian_vic:0 "Britannian Viceroyalty"
britannian_vic_desc:0 "A §YBritannian Viceroyalty§! is created as an semi-autonomous extension of the Holy Britannian Empire and it’s often ruled by a relative of the Imperial Family. Despite this, some Viceroyalties, due to specific circumstances, can be headed by powerful nobles or influential military strongmen. The Viceroy typically acts as the representative of the Emperor in Pendragon; hence, they hold supreme and complete authority in the Area. Despite different degrees of autonomy in internal affairs, common policies found in every Area are discrimination, forceful cultural assimilation and extensive economic exploitation. Generally, a strong military presence is often required in every Viceroyalty to deal with periodic discontent and occasional insurrections, but also guarantee the safety of local Britannian settlers and support the Imperial administration in its task to completely assimilate the Area."

imperial_cult:0 "Imperial Cult"
imperial_cult_desc:0 "The §YImperial Cult§! is an ideology championed by Lelouch vi Britannia upon ascending to the throne in Pendragon. It demands unwavering devotion to the Emperor, fueled by the augmented power of the Command Geass and extensive propaganda. Under this doctrine, all other entities, including corporations and the military, are expected to submit to the Emperor's absolute authority without question. The Imperial Cult is particularly antagonistic towards the aristocracy and the Purist Faction, advocating for their suppression in favor of a broader emancipation of the Numbers and other social groups. It espouses total personal and economic liberties for all, except in matters directly related to politics, which remain under the Emperor's exclusive purview. This ideology aims to consolidate power under a singular authority while promoting egalitarianism and individual freedoms within the Empire."

absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "§YAbsolute Monarchy§! is a form of government in which the monarch possesses unrestricted authority, unbound by any other institutions such as the church, legislature, or social elites. Grounded in the doctrine of Absolutism, the monarch's power is upheld by the "divine right of kings," attributing their authority to a divine mandate rather than human governance. While not worshipped as a deity, the monarch is viewed as the highest earthly representative of God. Characterized by a bureaucracy dedicated solely to the monarch, absolute monarchies grant the ruler the power to dissolve the government, appoint officials at will, and command the military. A formidable military force is crucial for both defense and expansion of the monarch's influence. Economic policies vary, serving to enrich the monarch and their inner circle, whether through mercantilism, capitalism, or corporatism. While often traditionalist, some absolute monarchs embrace Enlightenment principles to bolster their rule."

paternal_autocracy:0 "Paternal Autocracy"
paternal_autocracy_desc:0 "§YPaternal Autocracy§! is an ideological system characterized by the concentration of power in the hands of a single ruler, often referred to as a paternal figure. In this system, the ruler exercises absolute authority over all aspects of governance, economy, and society, with the belief that they are acting in the best interests of their subjects, akin to a caring father figure. Paternal Autocracy typically prioritizes stability, order, and traditional values, with the ruler often portrayed as the protector and provider for their people. While this form of government offers a sense of security and guidance, it often leads to the suppression of individual freedoms, lack of accountability, and potential for abuse of power."

purist_aristocracy:0 "Purist Aristocracy"
purist_aristocracy_desc:0 "The §YPurist Aristocracy§! represents one of the most radical factions within Britannia, advocating for racial purity alongside their staunch cultural xenophobia, in stark contrast to the policies of Honorary Britannians. Their ideology centers on the preservation of Britannian bloodlines and heritage, vehemently opposing any dilution of Britannian lineage. With unwavering loyalty to the Emperor in Pendragon, they seek to govern directly under his command, viewing themselves as the ultimate guardians of Britannian purity and tradition. This faction perceives themselves as the truest embodiment of Britannian ideals, advocating for a strict hierarchy based on lineage and ancestry. Their extreme views often lead to friction with other factions within the Empire, as they prioritize racial purity above all else, aiming to safeguard Britannia's legacy against perceived threats of dilution or contamination."

geass_cult:"Cult of the Geass"
geass_cult_desc:0 "The §YCult of Geass§! serves as the religious institution of the Geass Order, shrouded in esoteric mysticism and ancient origins. Its doctrines, known to only a select few, posit that free will is the root of all malevolence, advocating for mankind's control through subtle manipulation. Utilizing the mystical force of Geass, adherents have historically influenced pivotal events with varying degrees of success. The Cult is divided into two factions: followers of the Pontiff of Megiddo, intent on initiating Ragnarok, and agents of the enigmatic Son of Perun, pursuing their own enigmatic agendas with Geass and divinity. Amidst these factions, an unofficial third group, the Enlightened Inquisition, seeks to perpetuate the status quo clandestinely, exerting control over global affairs from the shadows."

integralism:0 "Populist Integralism"
integralism_desc:0 "§YPopulist Integralism§! is an ideology that combines elements of populism and integralism, emphasizing a holistic approach to governance rooted in the integration of diverse societal components. At its core, Populist Integralism aims to unify the nation under a shared identity while addressing the needs and concerns of the populace. It advocates for a strong, centralized state guided by traditional values and principles, with an emphasis on social cohesion and solidarity. Populist Integralists often appeal to the common people, presenting themselves as champions of the nation against perceived external threats or internal divisions. While promoting a sense of national unity, they may also prioritize economic redistribution and social welfare policies to address inequality and improve the well-being of all citizens."

ultra_nationalism:0 "Ultra-Nationalism"
ultra_nationalism_desc:0 "§YUltra-Nationalism§! is an extreme form of nationalism characterized by fervent devotion to one's nation, often to the exclusion or detriment of other groups. It promotes the idea of national superiority and seeks to preserve and promote the interests of the nation at all costs. Ultra-Nationalists typically advocate for aggressive and expansionist foreign policies, viewing military strength and territorial expansion as essential for national glory and dominance. This ideology often involves the demonization and scapegoating of minority groups, immigrants, or perceived internal enemies, blaming them for the nation's problems and advocating for their exclusion or suppression. Ultra-Nationalism can lead to authoritarianism, xenophobia, and even totalitarian regimes, as it prioritizes the interests of the nation above individual rights and freedoms."

national_syndacalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
national_syndacalism_desc:0 "§YNational Syndicalism§!, a contentious ideology prominent in right-wing circles, amalgamates nationalist fervor with syndicalist principles. Departing from Marxist analysis, it venerates myth and symbolism, idealizing the strike, the worker, and working-class life. Embracing revolutionary violence as a transformative force, National Syndicalists advocate for societal unionization, dividing it into "producer" and "consumer" unions to optimize the economy. Corporations are to be nationalized, and private property abolished, while vitalism and the creation of a "New Man" are endorsed socially. Hyper-masculinity, anti-individualism, and patriarchal values typify this ideology, with strict controls on immigration to preserve local jobs and culture. Rejecting bourgeois decadence, National Syndicalists prioritize the state, seeking to subjugate religion to its authority. Militarism is lauded, and paramilitary groups are encouraged, as expansionism is pursued to secure resources and living space for the populace."

japanese_militarism:0 "Japanese Militarism"
japanese_militarism_desc:0 "§YJapanese Militarism§! emerged as a radical faction within Tohdoh's clique, mirroring the xenophobic tendencies of its Britannian Purist counterpart. Advocating for a revival of Japanese military power, this faction promotes the creation of a new Japanese Empire, viewing the Japanese people as a superior race destined to lead all native populations of Asia. It seeks to dissolve political parties and reinstate an absolute monarchy dominated by the military, embodying an inherently totalitarian and militaristic ideology. Embracing militarism as a core tenet, Japanese Militarism envisions a society where the military holds paramount authority, guiding all aspects of governance and society."

WALTZ_LOC:0 "During the last decades three superpowers had been expanding their power: the Britannian Empire, the Chinese Federation and the Europian Universe. They had developed different political and social systems, but their goal is the same- dominate the entire world. As a result of the competition, only few nations have remained independent, struggling to survive between the three Leviathans. Until today, a fragile peace have been preserved; however with the recent tensions in the Pacific and a potential international crisis, nobody knows if this three-sided waltz will survive..."

OTHER_WALTZ_DESC:0 "Almost all nations in Earth are under the banner of one of the three superpowers, namely China, Britannia or United Europe. There are two exceptions in this order: Japan and the Middle Eastern Federation.\n\nThe first nation, also called the "Jewel of the Pacific" is the only democracy in the Pacific, and it's only alive thanks to its Sakuradite deposits; a similar logic can be applied to the Middle East. Will these territories be subjugated or their independence ethos will survive?"
