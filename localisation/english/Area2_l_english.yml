area_crime:0 "Blind Eye on Organised Crime"
area_crime_desc:0 "If we want to compete with the financial conglomerates of the Homeland, we must combine our industrial power with the connections and influence of local organized crime, which will have a free hand in its illegal activities.

area_destroy_ghettos:0 "Clear the Ghettos!"

ARE_Infastructure_Sector_3:0 "Infrastructure Sector 3"
	ARE_Infastructure_Sector_3_desc:0 "We must keep up the momentum we’ve gained so far. We shall clear up the old infrastructure to make way for new homes, factories, and facilities that will reinforce the very foundations of our nation."
ARE_Infastructure_Sector_4:0 "Infrastructure Sector 4"
	ARE_Infastructure_Sector_4_desc:0 "At last, the final phase of our infrastructure development plan shall commence. Our capital city will become self-sustainable for the foreseeable future, and its economy shall truly reflect that of a rising nation’s capital city."
ARE_Military_Sector:0 "Military Sector"
	ARE_Military_Sector_desc:0 "In order to be able to properly defend ourselves from exterior threats, we need an arms industry capable of supplying our infantry with weapons reliable enough to combat the ever-growing hostile forces that seek to undermine our stability as a nation."
ARE_Military_Sector_2:0 "Military Sector 2"
	ARE_Military_Sector_2_desc:0 "Another aspect we must consider is the large amounts of armor divisions our enemies may field. Let alone the possibility of facing knightmares. A technology that is quickly showing a new face of war and is developing rapidly into something beyond armor. We must invest in our artillery and anti tank capabilities. If we are to hold our own against such technological might."
ARE_Military_Sector_3:0 "Military Sector 3"
	ARE_Military_Sector_3_desc:0 "The skies are a theater of combat often overlooked in battle, but even so, we can clearly see that whoever controls the skies controls the flow of battle. Producing aircraft capable of guaranteeing our superiority in the sky is of utmost priority."

ARE_Prosperous_Nation:0 "A Prosperous Nation"
	ARE_Prosperous_Nation_desc:0 "Finally, our nation has reached true prosperity. Our people live off of the wealth provided to them from the recent expansion of our national economic industry. We have achieved what lesser nations could only dream of."
ARE_Pink_Saphires:0 "Pink Sapphires?"

ARE_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
	ARE_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "Our nation’s economic future is edging closer and closer to a militaristically centered one. Our war machine will continue to grow; can we sustain it indefinitely, or will it lead to our downfall?"
ARE_Advanced_Technical_Institute:0 "Advanced Technical Institute"
	ARE_Advanced_Technical_Institute_desc:0 "The recent growth of our industry has given us an increase in our capacity to innovate and improve upon our current technologies. We will gain the edge on other nations who believe themselves superior to us technologically."

# Navy Branch #
ARE_Establish_Admiralty:0 "Establish the Admiralty"
	ARE_Establish_Admiralty_desc:0 "It is finally time for our nation to reach out beyond our coastline. Before we can even consider sending ships out, we must establish both the admiralty and the chain of command. We only have a few men and women capable of filling this role within our nation. Let us hope they’re up to the challenge."
ARE_Confiscate_Dockyards:0 "Confiscate Civilian Dockyards"
	ARE_Confiscate_Dockyards_desc:0 "Though trade is vital to us in this uncertain time, we cannot sit idly by as the giants stomp around us, for it will only be a matter of time before we are the ones being stomped. We will confiscate ports, harbors, and any man-made outcroppings that are used for boat repairs. This makeshift collection of dockyards shall provide us with the ability to produce our own vessels of war."
ARE_Naval_School:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
	ARE_Naval_School_desc:0 "Now that we have a high admiral and a few vessels in the beginning stages of construction, we must establish an academy to train seamen into officers so that we can fill out the rest of the ranks in our command structure."
ARE_New_Age:0 "The New Age of Naval Warfare"
	ARE_New_Age_desc:0 "Although ship designs have not been altered much over the years, the tactics and roles for each ship class have changed drastically. We must catch up on our naval doctrines; otherwise, there is a significant chance that we may be caught unawares in our very first battle."
ARE_Coastal_Defense_Fleet:0 "Establish the Coastal Defense Fleet"
	ARE_Coastal_Defense_Fleet_desc:0 "With our production capabilities growing and our command structure firmly established, we can now distribute our first task to the navy. The goal of this task is nothing tougher than patrolling along our coastline to give the crew some experience on the sea. Though this may seem like a minor mission on the surface, it has successfully bolstered our nation's pride and hope."
ARE_Honorable_Battle:0 "The Honorable Tides of Battle"
	ARE_Honorable_Battle_desc:0 "Our nation is too prideful and honorable to hide beneath the waves like a skulking predator. We will stand tall and head towards our enemies with the might and grandeur once held by the fleets of old. We will pummel them with our formidable armaments."
ARE_Heavy_Ship_Design:0 "Heavy Ship Designs"
	ARE_Heavy_Ship_Design_desc:0 "Now that we have a strong screening fleet, we can safely escort our vessels across the seas. This also means that the time has come for us to think on a grander scale. Let us build vessels which rival even Britannia’s mightiest battlecarriers."
ARE_Standardized_Designs:0 "Standardize Designs"
	ARE_Standardized_Designs_desc:0 "We have successfully constructed multiple classes of surface fleet vessels. The expertise we have gained from this has shown us many of the flaws in our designs, some of which caused assembly to take longer than was necessary. As a result, we will finally be able to standardize our designs, allowing us to assemble light vessels faster than ever before."
ARE_Install_the_Repair_Yards:0 "Install Repair Yards"
	ARE_Install_the_Repair_Yards_desc:0 "With the possibility of war growing as the months pass by, the construction of dry dock repair yards would bolster our fleet’s survivability, allowing them to return to patrol without needing to wait months for repairs."
ARE_Flagship_for_the_Fleet:0 "A Flagship for the Fleet"
	ARE_Flagship_for_the_Fleet_desc:0 "What is a modern surface fleet without a flagship leading it? We could not in our right minds call ourselves a naval power without a crown for our fleet. Though we have enough resources to build such a ship, we only have enough for one capital vessel. The choice between a heavy cruiser or an aircraft carrier is currently giving rise to some rather heated debates among the admiralty."
ARE_Hidden_War:0 "The Hidden War"
	ARE_Hidden_War_desc:0 "With our nation being so limited in its production capabilities, it would be foolish of us to build a surface fleet for the sake of pride or ego. We should instead focus on predator tactics, remaining unnoticed until we strike our targets. A fleet of submarines would serve us better in the long run. Let us standardize their designs before anything else."
ARE_Fear_the_Unseen:0 "Fear the Unseen"
	ARE_Fear_the_Unseen_desc:0 "With a huge amount of time and effort saved by building smaller vessels, we can divert our efforts into updating our torpedoes’ capabilities and training our seamen to hold off on hitting a target until the last moment instead."
ARE_Lock_Down_the_Ocean:0 "Lock Down the Ocean"
	ARE_Lock_Down_the_Ocean_desc:0 "With our submarine designs standardized, it is time to increase the number of our patrols. This effort has been amplified by our new minelaying ships, which keep the areas around our nation on lockdown."
ARE_Mass-Produce_Parts:0 "Mass-Produce Parts"
	ARE_Mass-Produce_Parts_desc:0 "We cannot allow gaps in our patrols to form. To ensure that enemy ships cannot slip through our fleet, we must standardize the parts used to build our vessels themselves to increase the assembly speed of our submarines."
ARE_Deploy_the_Prototypes:0 "Deploy the Prototypes"
	ARE_Deploy_the_Prototypes_desc:0 "Specializing our naval production has finally paid off. The designers excitedly informed the admiralty that the new prototype submarines are ready to be let loose onto the sea. This came as a surprise to the admiralty, as they had not ordered or expected prototypes in any manner."

# Air Branch #
ARE_Air_Development:0 "Air Development"
	ARE_Air_Development_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that our air force is inadequate compared to those of the major powers of the world. We must correct this at once! Our aviation R&D department has been ordered to design new prototypes, both for weapons and Frame designs, to close the gap of power between us and our enemies."
ARE_Airbases:0 "Air Bases"
	ARE_Airbases_desc:0 "With new aircraft models being developed for our air force, we must create some airfields before we can begin assembly."
ARE_Air_Academy:0 "Found the Air Academy"
	ARE_Air_Academy_desc:0 "We have built ourselves an air force, but that is not enough to remain competitive in the war for the skies. We shall train our pilots to utilize the best tactics and strategies, bestowing them with so much knowledge that no foe shall best them in battle. They will become our guardians of the sky, and they shall know no fear."
ARE_Transport_Supplies:0 "Transport Supplies"
	ARE_Transport_Supplies_desc:0 "Times are changing. We can no longer depend solely on our ground infrastructure for the safe transportation of our supplies like we have been. After we pool together some funding, we will purchase some transport planes from the private sectors of other countries so that we may supply our forces without needing to depend on our roads and railways."
ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School:0 "Air Doctrine School"
	ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School_desc:0 "We need not look far to know we have much to learn in terms of aircraft and how to use them. Money has been spent, and books have been purchased; we shall use them to train our pilots."
ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School_2:0 "Air Doctrine School 2"
	ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School_2_desc:0 "We have learned some very valuable lessons in the time since our last meeting concerning the doctrine of our air force—lessons that have given us insight about how to proceed further with our pilots’ training."
ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School_3:0 "Air Doctrine School 3"
	ARE_aviation_Doctrine_School_3_desc:0 "Our nation has sufficiently acquainted itself with air combat to the point where our pilots have become as skilled as those serving the major powers. Why should we stop there? No, we will continue to apply what we’ve learned and improve our pilots’ skills even further. The stagnation of our air force would be tantamount to surrendering ourselves to the enemy should they choose to do the same."
ARE_Fighter_Focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
	ARE_Fighter_Focus_desc:0 "Bombers are powerful, yes, but they are slow and vulnerable. What our air force needs is not more bombers but a means to counter them as well as obliterate any aircraft that our enemies might choose to deploy."
ARE_Close_Air_Support:0 "Close Air Support"
	ARE_Close_Air_Support_desc:0 "The combined arms methodology can no longer be considered an optional doctrine. Combining air superiority with effective ground support is the best tactic for maintaining momentum in a battle. Ground support is best used in tandem with sudden air assaults. To make these combined arms maneuvers possible, we must have a foundation of close air support ready to fly at any time."
ARE_Bomber_Focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
	ARE_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "We have the industry required to support the most effective part of our air force: the bomber. These large machines of death can destroy our enemies’ backlines and turn the tides of battle for our soldiers on the frontlines."
ARE_Nothing_But_Ash:0 "Nothing but Ash"
	ARE_Nothing_But_Ash_desc:0 "Our air force’s primary goal should be to completely and utterly destroy our enemies’ ability to wage war. We shall endeavor to design the most powerful bombers the world has ever seen, and we will use them to target not just our enemies’ industries but their infrastructure as well, leaving their troops starved for supplies and vulnerable to our ground forces."

# Army Branch #
ARE_Army_Development:0 "Army Development"
	ARE_Army_Development_desc:0 "The time has come to reevaluate our military to prepare ourselves for the new age of warfare and research how we want to proceed."
ARE_Artillery_Development:0 "Artillery Development"
	ARE_Artillery_Development_desc:0 "Artillery has proven itself extremely effective in taking out the sturdiest of armies. To have an army without it in this day and age is not only unwise but incredibly stupid. We shall study reports from our troops in the field to develop better artillery."
ARE_Motorized_Development:0 "Motorized Development"
	ARE_Motorized_Development_desc:0 "The last few centuries have been a bastion of innovation and experimentation for warfare and technology. Among the many things learned, we have discovered the effectiveness of motorized equipment in an army. We shall pool together our scientists to advance our understanding of these simple yet very important machines."
ARE_Firearms_Development:0 "Firearms Development"
	ARE_Firearms_Development_desc:0 "What could be more important for an army than the humble gun? Even these fancy new Knightmares have their own guns. Thankfully, we can borrow knowledge from the private sector of other countries to help develop better firearms."
ARE_Armor_Development:0 "Armor Development"
	ARE_Armor_Development_desc:0 "Tanks are the only thing proving to be effective against Britannian Knightmares, and even then, they have been struggling. We must act quickly to develop better tanks to counter Knightmares."
ARE_New_RND_Department:0 "A New R&D Department"
	ARE_New_RND_Department_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that we need more scientists in order to keep up with our enemies. We have gathered the funds and the necessary people to establish a brand new research department to support our current ones."
ARE_army_Doctrine_School:0 "Army Doctrine School"
	ARE_army_Doctrine_School_desc:0 "Many important factors go into the creation of a successful military, but one of the most crucial is the command structure. We need effective officers and AREerals to be able to wage war; otherwise, our military would be incredibly ineffective and sluggish. We shall ensure only the most skilled and experienced people, and thus the most qualified, will be promoted."
ARE_army_Doctrine_School_2:0 "Army Doctrine School 2"
	ARE_army_Doctrine_School_2_desc:0 "Although armor is still prevalent presently, the future will very clearly be driven by Knightmares. Foot infantry will not survive in the coming age. If we wish for them to even survive first contact with the enemy, we must ensure they receive supplies of MANPATS, or man-portable anti-tank systems, to keep them alive and capable of fighting against any Knightmares or armored enemies."
ARE_army_Doctrine_School_3:0 "Army Doctrine School 3"
	ARE_army_Doctrine_School_3_desc:0 "With new Knightmare prototypes being unveiled yearly, we must discuss two variants: melee and fortress. Melee Knightmares sacrifice defensiveness for armor penetration and are able to form spearheads against most Knightmare variants. Fortress Knightmares don’t really have any offensive capabilities but are defensive powerhouses, requiring advanced Frames or anti-Knightmare artillery to take down."
ARE_army_Doctrine_School_4:0 "Army Doctrine School 4"
	ARE_army_Doctrine_School_4_desc:0 "The last Knightmare Frame variant we must address is the advanced, or so-called “all-purpose”, variant. This marvel, or terror, of technology is the one thing we should avoid at all costs. Only anti-Knightmare artillery have the capabilities to stop them. If our soldiers encounter one, they must know to either stand firm and wait for reinforcements or fall back to the main front. Do not engage."
ARE_army_Doctrine_School_5:0 "Army Doctrine School 5"
	ARE_army_Doctrine_School_5_desc:0 "Anti-Knightmare artillery have become a staple asset for fighting Knightmares. Whether we commit to one or the other, we must study ways to work with or against them. We could counter the artillery with intelliAREt tactics, such as having our infantry assault these unwieldy machines, or, if we utilize such weapons, place them at strategic points where our enemies would struggle to defeat them."
ARE_Knightmare_Warfare:0 "Knightmare Warfare"
	ARE_Knightmare_Warfare_desc:0 "A new age of warfare is upon us; we shall not let ourselves fall to the wayside. Knightmares are the way forward, and we will take full advantage of them by developing our own to compete with the major powers should the need arise."
ARE_The_Facts:0 "Spin the Facts"
	ARE_The_Facts_desc:0 "Factsphere sensors and landspinners are essential components for Knightmares. We need to develop these technologies right away. Spare no expense!"
ARE_Knightmared_Police:0 "Knightmare Police"
	ARE_Knightmared_Police_desc:0 "Police forces have been essential in upholding law and order in the world, but in this day and age, terrorism and rebellion are their main opponents. We shall endeavor to create a Knightmare Frame which our police officers can use to defend our streets from these threats and, in an emerAREcy, be used in combat against insurAREts."
ARE_Buy_Used_Stock:0 "Buy Used Stock"
	ARE_Buy_Used_Stock_desc:0 "Who said we needed to build all of our Knightmares? There are plenty of secondhand models and stock on the black market to supply us with enough Knightmares to at least create a division of them. We shall quickly gather our men and train them to use these Knightmares to defend our homeland."
ARE_Our_Own_Roundtable:0 "Our Own Round Table"
	ARE_Our_Own_Roundtable_desc:0 "Britannia boasts its own elite unit composed of their best and brightest Knightmare pilots called the Knights of the Round.
