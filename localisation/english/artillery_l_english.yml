 eu_war_anti_air:0 "Post EU War Anti-Air"
 eu_war_anti_air_desc:0 "An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as armored personnel carriers and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment."
 modern_spaa_1:0 "Modern SPAA"
 modern_spaa_1_desc:0 "Modern SPAA are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. In addition, most anti-aircraft guns can be used in a direct-fire role against surface targets to great effect. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns"
 modern_spaa_2:0 "Modern SPAA II"
 modern_spaa_2_desc:0 "These types of SPAA are not really different from their predecessors, although the mortality rates inside the vehicle have been greatly reduced. With an improved precision and situation awareness, SPAA are still dangerously vulnerable to Knightmare attacks and heavy weapons' targeting."
 modern_spaa_3:0 "Modern SPAA III"
 modern_spaa_3_desc:0 "Latest versions of Self-Propelled Anti-Air saw the introduction of multiple surface-to-air missiles and two 30mm cannons. Standard equipment includes a computerized fire control system, heating, ventilation, NBC system and other features that greatly improves the capabilities of this weapon. In addition, a target acquisition radar is mounted on the rear top of the turret, which can detect enemy aircrafts flying high as 3.500 metres."
 modern_spaa_2_upgrade_1:0 "SPAA II General Upgrade"
 modern_spaa_2_upgrade_1_desc:0 "For the first time, a reactive armor has been implemented on the SPAA with great results, but the most important feature is the general Computerization of the principal functions of the vehicle. This includes an automatic gear change and automatic fire detection and suppression system."
 modern_spaa_1_upgrade_1:0 "SPAA I General Upgrade"
 modern_spaa_1_upgrade_1_desc:0 "The first round of innovation of SPAA vehicles comes with the use of stabilizers ,to improve precision, and small arms to better counter infantry attacks from the ground."
 modern_spaa_3_upgrade_1:0 "SPAA III General Upgrade"
 modern_spaa_3_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Further advancements includes special cannons, specifically produced to hunt down Knightmares with a Floating System. These integrations are supported with a reinforced armor that can protect the vehicle from Hadron cannons and long range artillery fire."
 raiko_artillery_unit:0 "Anti-KN Artillery"


 eu_war_artillery:0 "Post EU War Artillery"
 eu_war_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use."
 modern_artillery:0 "Early SP Artillery"
 modern_artillery_desc:0 "Self-propelled artillery is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move toward its firing position. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large field gun, howitzer, mortar, or some form of rocket/missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield."

 fire_control_system:0 "Fire Control System"
 fire_control_system_desc:0 "The optical fire control system is the optical-mechanical system used for orienting a weapon (howitzer, mortar, cannon, etc) on a target. It allows the gun’s crewmembers to accurately traverse and elevate the weapon to a visible target or a directed set of coordinates; in addition, this type of fire control system is comprised of telescopes, mounts, and quadrants."
 anti_kn_features:0 "Anti-KN Design"
 anti_kn_features_desc:0 "Majority of Self Propelled Artillery has become less and less effective against Knightmare weapons; for this reason, it's necessary a new support force, inside normal battalions, that will target only Knightmares."
 UNLOCK_KN_ART:0 "This Will Be The First Step Towards Anti-Knightmare Artillery"
 sp_artillery_1:0 "SP Artillery"
 sp_artillery_1_desc:0 "These models of SP artillery operates in conjugation with current command and control systems and delivers outstanding tracking capability to fire rounds for a maximum range of 50km. Its cabin is designed to protect the crew from artillery fragments and mines, as well as nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) threats. The system completes the firing sequence and leaves the place of action in just 40 seconds. The highly mobile vehicle provides a maximum speed of 70km/h and a cruising range of 500km."
 varied_propellant_artillery:0 "Bulk Loaded Liquid Propellant"
 varied_propellant_artillery_desc:0 "Bulk loaded liquid propellants are an artillery technology that presents various advantages;those would be simpler guns and a wider range of tactical and logistic options. Better accuracy and tactical flexibility would theoretically come from standard shells with varying propellant loads, and logistic simplification by eliminating varying powder loads."
 modern_artillery_1:0 "Rocket Artillery"
 modern_artillery_1_desc:0 "Rocket artillery is artillery that uses rocket explosives as the projectile. Rockets have different capabilities than artillery, like longer range and different payloads, typically considerably larger warheads than a similarly sized artillery platform or multiple warheads. Unguided rocket artillery is notoriously inaccurate and slow to reload compared to artillery."
 multiple_rounds_simultaneous_impact_1:0 "Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact"
 multiple_rounds_simultaneous_impact_1_desc:0 "Multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI) is a modern version of the earlier time on target concept. MRSI is when a single gun fires multiple shells to all arrive at the same target simultaneously.  Typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by using different sized propellant charges with each shell, it is possible to utilize more than two trajectories."
 modern_artillery_2:0 "Rocket Artillery II"
 modern_artillery_2_desc:0 "More advanced rocket artillery vehicles have managed to totally overcome unprecision problems with systems that can launch multiple rockets simultaneously, combined with the use of GPS or inertial guidance. Furthermore, several improvements of the mobility have shown great results in the battlefield."
 sp_artillery_2:0 "SP Artillery II"
 sp_artillery_2_desc:0 "The howitzer can fire high-explosive precision-guided munitions, jammer carrying projectiles, anti-tank submunitions, as well as standard and rocket-assisted high explosive-fragmentation (HE-FRAG) projectiles. The rate of fire is eight rounds a minute while the maximum firing range is 70km. The vehicle has still a maximum speed of 60km/h and an operational range of 500km."
 knightmare_coilgun_deployment:0 "Anti-Knightmare Coilgun Deployment"
 knightmare_coilgun_deployment_desc:0 "Raiko Artillery has shown great result so far, but also its limits. For this reason, a standardisation of Anti-Knightmare weapons will be necessary. In particular, a smaller Anti-KN coilgun will be put in place,near the main cannon. Although it will present less effectiveness than the Raiko, it will save numerous vehicles from destruction."
 high_explosives_tearing_projectiles:0 "High Explosives Tearing Projectiles"
 high_explosives_tearing_projectiles_desc:0 "The M694 Super- High Explosive artillery projectile introduces an unique solution based on a pre-fragmented drogue parachute warhead, designed to detonate at an optimum height above the target. This type of projectile is 5 times more effective against Knightmares and heavy armored vehicles compared to standard projectiles."
 raiko_artillery:0 "Raiko Artillery"
 raiko_artillery_desc:0 "A massive coilgun built from four Glasgows or the Burais variants. It fires a type of canister shot: a high-velocity shell which releases two-dozen steel ball bearings that can tear through Knightmare Frames, as well as most other targets with ease. The four Knightmares are arranged along both sides of the cannon for support, and their heads are attached to a circular disc on the top of the cannon for a 360 degree field of view."
 bulk_loaded_liquid_propellant:0 "Reinforced Transmission"
 bulk_loaded_liquid_propellant_desc:0 "Of course, the new artillery piece will have to sustain the weight of several Knightmares and heavy ammunitions. For this reason, a reinforced armor, along a new transmission will be implemented; a new metallic league made out of Iron and neutralized Sakuradite will be used."
 modern_artillery_3:0 "Rocket Artillery III"
 modern_artillery_3_desc:0 "The most modern piece of rocket artillery posseses particular rockets that can reach the target in a short period of time. This is combined with an electro-magnetic field that blocks enemy's projectiles and attacks alike. These enhancements have succeded in making artillery capable of facing Knightmares for the first time in a long time."
 sp_artillery_3:0 "SP Artillery III"
 sp_artillery_3_desc:0 "Having reached its maximum development, SP artillery has only adapted to a more computerized system, with less and less work being done by human operators. Capabilities have also improved with larger spaces for ammunitions as well, and multiple defenses against different attacks."
 sakuradite_engine:0 "Sakuradite Engine"
 sakuradite_engine_desc:0 "In order to further improve SP artillery's mobility and firepower, some fragments of Sakuradite and a small and simpler version of the Yggdrasil Engine will be implemented inside the vehicles. Although it will present an high risk of potential self-damages, even deadly, it will give a great advantage over the enemy."
 super_heavy_artillery:0 "Super Heavy Artillery"
 super_heavy_artillery_desc:0 "The artillery a is pyramid-shaped land-cruising mobile fortress. It has two large cannons and thirteen smaller cannons. Certain models are equipped with tank treads for land mobility, while others have hover systems to levitate across bodies of water. The Longdan's large cannons pretty much serve the same role as their main guns can destroy most knightmare frame that get within firing range."
